<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ
which are at Colossæ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span>
i, 1, 2 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We may say that each of Paul&#8217;s greater epistles
has in it one salient thought. In that to
the Romans, it is Justification by faith; in Ephesians,
it is the mystical union of Christ and His
Church; in Philippians, it is the joy of Christian
progress; in this epistle, it is the dignity and sole
sufficiency of Jesus Christ as the Mediator and Head
of all creation and of the Church.</p>

<p>Such a thought is emphatically a lesson for the
day.</p>

<p>The Christ whom the world needs to have proclaimed
in every deaf ear and lifted up before
blind and reluctant eyes, is not merely the perfect
man, nor only the meek sufferer, but the Source of
creation and its Lord, Who from the beginning has
been the life of all that has lived, and before the
beginning was in the bosom of the Father. The
shallow and starved religion which contents itself
with mere humanitarian conceptions of Jesus of
Nazareth needs to be deepened and filled out by
these lofty truths before it can acquire solidity and
steadfastness sufficient to be the unmoved foundation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of sinful and mortal lives. The evangelistic teaching
which concentrates exclusive attention on the
cross as &ldquo;the work of Christ,&rdquo; needs to be led to
the contemplation of them, in order to understand
the cross, and to have its mystery as well as its
meaning declared. This letter itself dwells upon
two applications of its principles to two classes of
error which, in somewhat changed forms, exist now
as then&mdash;the error of the ceremonialist, to whom
religion was mainly a matter of ritual, and the error
of the speculative thinker, to whom the universe was
filled with forces which left no room for the working
of a personal Will. The vision of the living
Christ Who fills all things, is held up before each of
these two, as the antidote to his poison; and that
same vision must be made clear to-day to the
modern representatives of these ancient errors. If
we are able to grasp with heart and mind the
principles of this epistle for ourselves, we shall stand
at the centre of things, seeing order where from any
other position confusion only is apparent, and being
at the point of rest instead of being hurried along
by the wild whirl of conflicting opinions.</p>

<p>I desire, therefore, to present the teachings of this
great epistle in a series of expositions.</p>

<p>Before advancing to the consideration of these
verses, we must deal with one or two introductory
matters, so as to get the frame and the background
for the picture.</p>

<p>(1) First, as to the Church of Colossæ to which
the letter is addressed.</p>

<p>Perhaps too much has been made of late years of
geographical and topographical elucidations of Paul&#8217;s
epistles. A knowledge of the place to which a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
letter was sent cannot do much to help in understanding
the letter, for local circumstances leave
very faint traces, if any, on the Apostle&#8217;s writings.
Here and there an allusion may be detected, or a
metaphor may gain in point by such knowledge;
but, for the most part, local colouring is entirely
absent. Some slight indication, however, of the
situation and circumstances of the Colossian Church
may help to give vividness to our conceptions of the
little community to whom this rich treasure of truth
was first entrusted.</p>

<p>Colossæ was a town in the heart of the modern
Asia Minor, much decayed in Paul&#8217;s time from its
earlier importance. It lay in a valley of Phrygia,
on the banks of a small stream, the Lycus, down
the course of which, at a distance of some ten miles
or so, two very much more important cities fronted
each other, Hierapolis on the north, and Laodicea
on the south bank of the river. In all three cities
were Christian Churches, as we know from this
letter, one of which has attained the bad eminence
of having become the type of tepid religion for all
the world. How strange to think of the tiny
community in a remote valley of Asia Minor,
eighteen centuries since, thus gibbeted for ever!
These stray beams of light which fall upon the
people in the New Testament, showing them fixed for
ever in one attitude, like a lightning flash in the darkness,
are solemn precursors of the last Apocalypse,
when all men shall be revealed in &ldquo;the brightness
of His coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul does not seem to have been the founder of
these Churches, or ever to have visited them at the
date of this letter. That opinion is based on several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of its characteristics, such, for instance, as the
absence of any of those kindly greetings to individuals
which in the Apostle&#8217;s other letters are so
abundant, and reveal at once the warmth and the
delicacy of his affection: and the allusions which
occur more than once to his having only &ldquo;<i>heard</i>&rdquo; of
their faith and love, and is strongly supported by the
expression in the second chapter where he speaks
of the conflict in spirit which he had for &ldquo;you, and
for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not
seen my face in the flesh.&rdquo; Probably the teacher
who planted the gospel in Colossæ was that
Epaphras, whose visit to Rome occasioned the
letter, and who is referred to in verse 7 of this
chapter in terms which seem to suggest that he had
first made known to them the fruit-producing &ldquo;word
of the truth of the gospel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(2) Note the occasion and subject of the letter.
Paul is a prisoner, in a certain sense, in Rome;
but the word prisoner conveys a false impression of
the amount of restriction of personal liberty to
which he was subjected. We know from the last
words of the Acts of the Apostles, and from the
Epistle to the Philippians, that his &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo;
did not in the least interfere with his liberty of
preaching, nor with his intercourse with friends.
Rather, in the view of the facilities it gave that by
him &ldquo;the preaching might be fully known,&rdquo; it may
be regarded, as indeed the writer of the Acts seems
to regard it, as the very climax and topstone of
Paul&#8217;s work, wherewith his history may fitly end,
leaving the champion of the gospel at the very heart
of the world, with unhindered liberty to proclaim
his message by the very throne of Cæsar. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sheltered rather than confined beneath the wing of
the imperial eagle. His imprisonment, as we call it,
was, at all events at first, detention in Rome under
military supervision rather than incarceration. So
to his lodgings in Rome there comes a brother from
this decaying little town in the far-off valley of the
Lycus, Epaphras by name. Whether his errand was
exclusively to consult Paul about the state of the
Colossian Church, or whether some other business
also had brought him to Rome, we do not know; at
all events, he comes and brings with him bad news,
which burdens Paul&#8217;s heart with solicitude for the
little community, which had no remembrances of his
own authoritative teaching to fall back upon. Many
a night would he and Epaphras spend in deep converse
on the matter, with the stolid Roman legionary,
to whom Paul was chained, sitting wearily by, while
they two eagerly talked.</p>

<p>The tidings were that a strange disease, hatched
in that hotbed of religious fancies, the dreamy East,
was threatening the faith of the Colossian Christians.
A peculiar form of heresy, singularly compounded
of Jewish ritualism and Oriental mysticism&mdash;two
elements as hard to blend in the foundation of a
system as the heterogeneous iron and clay on which
the image in Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream stood unstably&mdash;had
appeared among them, and though at present
confined to a few, was being vigorously preached.
The characteristic Eastern dogma, that matter is
evil and the source of evil, which underlies so much
Oriental religion, and crept in so early to corrupt
Christianity, and crops up to-day in so many strange
places and unexpected ways, had begun to infect
them. The conclusion was quickly drawn: &ldquo;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
then, if matter be the source of all evil, then, of
course, God and matter must be antagonistic,&rdquo; and
so the creation and government of this material
universe could not be supposed to have come
directly from Him. The endeavour to keep the
pure Divinity and the gross world as far apart as
possible, while yet an intellectual necessity forbad
the entire breaking of the bond between them, led
to the busy working of the imagination, which
spanned the void gulf between God Who is good,
and matter which is evil, with a bridge of cobwebs&mdash;a
chain of intermediate beings, emanations, abstractions,
each approaching more nearly to the
material than his precursor, till at last the intangible
and infinite was confined and curdled into actual
earthly matter, and the pure was darkened thereby
into evil.</p>

<p>Such notions, fantastic and remote from daily life
as they look, really led by a very short cut to
making wild work with the plainest moral teachings
both of the natural conscience and of Christianity.
For if matter be the source of all evil, then the
fountain of each man&#8217;s sin is to be found, not in his
own perverted will, but in his body, and the cure of
it is to be reached, not by faith which plants a new
life in a sinful spirit, but simply by ascetic mortification
of the flesh.</p>

<p>Strangely united with these mystical Eastern
teachings, which might so easily be perverted to
the coarsest sensuality, and had their heads in the
clouds and their feet in the mud, were the narrowest
doctrines of Jewish ritualism, insisting on circumcision,
laws regulating food, the observance of feast days,
and the whole cumbrous apparatus of a ceremonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
religion. It is a monstrous combination, a cross
between a Talmudical rabbi and a Buddhist priest,
and yet it is not unnatural that, after soaring in
these lofty regions of speculation where the air is too
thin to support life, men should be glad to get hold
of the externals of an elaborate ritual. It is not the
first nor the last time that a misplaced philosophical
religion has got close to a religion of outward observances,
to keep it from shivering itself to death.
Extremes meet. If you go far enough east, you are
west.</p>

<p>Such, generally speaking, was the error that was
beginning to lift its head in Colossæ. Religious
fanaticism was at home in that country, from which,
both in heathen and in Christian times, wild rites
and notions emanated, and the Apostle might well
dread the effect of this new teaching, as of a spark
on hay, on the excitable natures of the Colossian
converts.</p>

<p>Now we may say, &ldquo;What does all this matter to
us? We are in no danger of being haunted by the
ghosts of these dead heresies.&rdquo; But the truth which
Paul opposed to them is all important for every age.
It was simply the Person of Christ as the only manifestation
of the Divine, the link between God and
the universe, its Creator and Preserver, the Light and
Life of men, the Lord and Inspirer of the Church,
Christ has come, laying His hand upon both God and
man, therefore there is no need nor place for a misty
crowd of angelic beings or shadowy abstractions to
bridge the gulf across which His incarnation flings
its single solid arch. Christ has been bone of our
bone and flesh of our flesh, therefore that cannot be
the source of evil in which the fulness of the Godhead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
has dwelt as in a shrine. Christ has come, the
fountain of life and holiness, therefore there is no
more place for ascetic mortifications on the one hand,
nor for Jewish scrupulosities on the other. These
things might detract from the completeness of faith
in the complete redemption which Christ has wrought,
and must becloud the truth that simple faith in it is
all which a man needs.</p>

<p>To urge these and the like truths this letter is
written. Its central principle is the sovereign and
exclusive mediation of Jesus Christ, the God-man,
the victorious antagonist of these dead speculations,
and the destined conqueror of all the doubts and confusions
of this day. If we grasp with mind and
heart that truth, we can possess our souls in patience,
and in its light see light where else is darkness and
uncertainty.</p>

<hr />

<p>So much then for introduction, and now a few
words of comment on the superscription of the letter
contained in these verses.</p>

<p>I. Notice the blending of lowliness and authority
in Paul&#8217;s designation of himself. &ldquo;An Apostle of
Christ Jesus through the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He does not always bring his apostolic authority
to mind at the beginning of his letters. In his
earliest epistles, those to the Thessalonians, he has
not yet adopted the practice. In the loving and
joyous letter to the Philippians, he has no need to
urge his authority, for no man among them ever
gainsaid it. In that to Philemon, friendship is uppermost,
and though, as he says, he might be much bold
to enjoin, yet he prefers to beseech, and will not
command as &ldquo;Apostle,&rdquo; but pleads as &ldquo;the prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In his other letters he put his
authority in the foreground as here, and it may be
noticed that it and its basis in the will of God are
asserted with greatest emphasis in the Epistle to the
Galatians, where he has to deal with more defiant
opposition than elsewhere encountered him.</p>

<p>Here he puts forth his claim to the apostolate,
in the highest sense of the word. He asserts his
equality with the original Apostles, the chosen witnesses
for the reality of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. He,
too, had seen the risen Lord, and heard the words of
His mouth. He shared with them the prerogative
of certifying from personal experience that Jesus
is risen and lives to bless and rule. Paul&#8217;s whole
Christianity was built on the belief that Jesus Christ
had actually appeared to him. That vision on the
road to Damascus revolutionised his life. Because
he had seen his Lord and heard his duty from His
lips, he had become what he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through the will of God&rdquo; is at once an assertion
of Divine authority, a declaration of independence
of all human teaching or appointment, and a most
lowly disclaimer of individual merit, or personal
power. Few religious teachers have had so strongly
marked a character as Paul, or have so constantly
brought their own experience into prominence; but
the weight which he expected to be attached to his
words was to be due entirely to their being the
words which God spoke through him. If this opening
clause were to be paraphrased it would be: I
speak to you because God has sent me. I am not
an Apostle by my own will, nor by my own merit.
I am not worthy to be called an Apostle. I am a
poor sinner like yourselves, and it is a miracle of love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and mercy that God should put His words into such
lips. But He does speak through me; my words
are neither mine nor learned from any other man,
but His. Never mind the cracked pipe through
which the Divine breath makes music, but listen to
the music.</p>

<p>So Paul thought of his message; so the uncompromising
assertion of authority was united with deep
humility. Do we come to his words, believing that
we hear God speaking through Paul? Here is no
formal doctrine of inspiration, but here is the claim
to be the organ of the Divine will and mind, to which
we ought to listen as indeed the voice of God.</p>

<p>The gracious humility of the man is further seen
in his association with himself, as joint senders of
the letter, of his young brother Timothy, who has
no apostolic authority, but whose concurrence in its
teaching might give it some additional weight. For
the first few verses he remembers to speak in the
plural, as in the name of both&mdash;&ldquo;<i>we</i> give thanks,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Epaphras declared to <i>us</i> your love,&rdquo; and so on;
but in the fiery sweep of his thoughts Timothy is
soon left out of sight, and Paul alone pours out the
wealth of his Divine wisdom and the warmth of his
fervid heart.</p>

<p>II. We may observe the noble ideal of the Christian
character set forth in the designations of the
Colossian Church, as &ldquo;saints and faithful brethren in
Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his earlier letters Paul addresses himself to
&ldquo;the Church;&rdquo; in his later, beginning with the
Epistle to the Romans, and including the three great
epistles from his captivity, namely, Ephesians, Philippians,
and Colossians, he drops the word Church, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
uses expressions which regard the individuals composing
the community rather than the community
which they compose. The slight change thus indicated
in the Apostle&#8217;s point of view is interesting,
however it may be accounted for. There is no reason
to suppose it done of set purpose, and certainly it
did not arise from any lowered estimate of the sacredness
of &ldquo;the Church,&rdquo; which is nowhere put on higher
ground than in the letter to Ephesus, which belongs
to the later period; but it may be that advancing
years and familiarity with his work, with his position
of authority, and with his auditors, all tended to draw
him closer to them, and insensibly led to the disuse
of the more formal and official address to &ldquo;the
Church&rdquo; in favour of the simpler and more affectionate
superscription, to &ldquo;the brethren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the lessons to be drawn from the
names here given to the members of the Church are
the more important matter for us. It would be interesting
and profitable to examine the meaning of
all the New Testament names for believers, and to
learn the lessons which they teach; but we must for
the present confine ourselves to those which occur
here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saints&rdquo;&mdash;a word that has been wofully misapplied
both by the Church and the world. The former has
given it as a special honour to a few, and &ldquo;decorated&rdquo;
with it mainly the possessors of a false ideal of
sanctity&mdash;that of the ascetic and monastic sort. The
latter uses it with a sarcastic intonation, as if it implied
much cry and little wool, loud professions and
small performance, not without a touch of hypocrisy
and crafty self-seeking.</p>

<p>Saints are not people living in cloisters after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fantastic ideal, but men and women immersed in the
vulgar work of every-day life and worried by the
small prosaic anxieties which fret us all, who amidst
the whirr of the spindle in the mill, and the clink of
the scales on the counter, and the hubbub of the
market-place and the jangle of the courts, are yet
living lives of conscious devotion to God. The root
idea of the word, which is an Old Testament word,
is not moral purity, but separation to God. The
holy things of the old covenant were things set
apart from ordinary use for His service. So, on
the high priest&#8217;s mitre was written Holiness to the
Lord. So the Sabbath was kept &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; because
set apart from the week in obedience to Divine
command.</p>

<p><i>Sanctity</i>, and <i>saint</i>, are used now mainly with the
idea of moral purity, but that is a secondary meaning.
The real primary signification is separation to
God. Consecration to Him is the root from which
the white flower of purity springs most surely. There
is a deep lesson in the word as to the true method
of attaining cleanness of life and spirit. We cannot
make ourselves pure, but we can yield ourselves to
God and the purity will come.</p>

<p>But we have not only here the fundamental idea
of holiness, and the connection of purity of character
with self-consecration to God, but also the solemn
obligation on all so-called Christians thus to separate
and devote themselves to Him. We are Christians
as far as we give ourselves up to God, in the surrender
of our wills and the practical obedience of
our lives&mdash;so far and not one inch further. We
are not merely bound to this consecration if we are
Christians, but we are not Christians unless we thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
consecrate ourselves. Pleasing self, and making my
own will my law, and living for my own ends, is
destructive of all Christianity. Saints are not an
eminent sort of Christians, but all Christians are
saints, and he who is not a saint is not a Christian.
The true consecration is the surrender of the will,
which no man can do for us, which needs no
outward ceremonial, and the one motive which will
lead us selfish and stubborn men to bow our necks
to that gentle yoke, and to come out of the misery
of pleasing self into the peace of serving God, is
drawn from the great love of Him Who devoted
Himself to God and man, and bought us for His
own by giving Himself utterly to be ours. All
sanctity begins with consecration to God. All consecration
rests upon the faith of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice.
And if, drawn by the great love of Christ to us
unworthy, we give ourselves away to God in Him,
then He gives Himself in deep sacred communion
to us. &ldquo;I am thine&rdquo; has ever for its chord which
completes the fulness of its music, &ldquo;Thou art mine.&rdquo;
And so &ldquo;saint&rdquo; is a name of dignity and honour,
as well as a stringent requirement. There is implied
in it, too, safety from all that would threaten
life or union with Him. He will not hold His
possessions with a slack hand that negligently lets
them drop, or with a feeble hand that cannot keep
them from a foe. &ldquo;Thou wilt not suffer him who
is consecrated to Thee to see corruption.&rdquo; If I
belong to God, having given myself to Him, then
I am safe from the touch of evil and the taint of
decay. &ldquo;The Lord&#8217;s portion is His people,&rdquo; and
He will not lose even so worthless a part of that
portion as I am. The great name &ldquo;saints&rdquo; carries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with it the prophecy of victory over all evil, and
the assurance that nothing can separate us from
the love of God, or pluck us from His hand.</p>

<p>But these Colossian Christians are &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; as
well as saints. That may either mean <i>trustworthy</i>
and <i>true</i> to their stewardship, or <i>trusting</i>. In the
parallel verses in the Epistle to the Ephesians
(which presents so many resemblances to this
epistle) the latter meaning seems to be required,
and here it is certainly the more natural, as pointing
to the very foundation of all Christian consecration
and brotherhood in the act of believing. We
are united to Christ by our faith. The Church is a
family of faithful, that is to say of believing, men.
Faith underlies consecration and is the parent of
holiness, for he only will yield himself to God who
trustfully grasps the mercies of God and rests on
Christ&#8217;s great gift of Himself. Faith weaves the
bond that unites men in the brotherhood of the
Church, for it brings all who share it into a common
relation to the Father. He who is faithful, that is,
believing, will be faithful in the sense of being
worthy of confidence and true to his duty, his
profession, and his Lord.</p>

<p>They were <i>brethren</i> too. That strong new bond
of union among men the most unlike, was a strange
phenomenon in Paul&#8217;s time, when the Roman world
was falling to pieces, and rent by deep clefts of
hatreds and jealousies such as modern society
scarcely knows; and men might well wonder as
they saw the slave and his master sitting at the
same table, the Greek and the barbarian learning
the same wisdom in the same tongue, the Jew
and the Gentile bowing the knee in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
worship, and the hearts of all fused into one great
glow of helpful sympathy and unselfish love.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; means more than this. It points
not merely to Christian love, but to the common
possession of a new life. If we are brethren, it is
because we have one Father, because in us all there
is one life. The name is often regarded as sentimental
and metaphorical. The obligation of mutual
love is supposed to be the main idea in it,
and there is a melancholy hollowness and unreality
in the very sound of it as applied to the usual
average Christians of to-day. But the name leads
straight to the doctrine of regeneration, and proclaims
that all Christians are born again through
their faith in Jesus Christ, and thereby partake of
a common new life, which makes all its possessors
children of the Highest, and therefore brethren one
of another. If regarded as an expression of the
affection of Christians for one another, &ldquo;brethren&rdquo;
is an exaggeration, ludicrous or tragic, as we view
it; but if we regard it as the expression of the real
bond which gathers all believers into one family, it
declares the deepest mystery and mightiest privilege
of the gospel that &ldquo;to as many as received Him, to
them gave He power to become the Sons of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They are &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; These two words may
apply to all the designations or to the last only.
They are saints in Him, believers in Him, brethren
in Him. That mystical but most real union of
Christians with their Lord is never far away from
the Apostle&#8217;s thoughts, and in the twin Epistle to
the Ephesians is the very burden of the whole.
A shallower Christianity tries to weaken that great
phrase to something more intelligible to the unspiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
temper and the poverty-stricken experience
proper to it; but no justice can be done to Paul&#8217;s
teaching unless it be taken in all its depth as
expressive of that same mutual indwelling and interlacing
of spirit with spirit which is so prominent
in the writings of the Apostle John. <i>There</i> is one
point of contact between the Pauline and the
Johannean conceptions, on the differences between
which so much exaggeration has been expended:
to both the inmost essence of the Christian life is
union to Christ, and abiding in Him. If we are
Christians, we are in Him, in yet profounder sense
than creation lives and moves and has its being in
God. We are in Him as the earth with all its
living things is in the atmosphere, as the branch is
in the vine, as the members are in the body. We
are in Him as inhabitants in a house, as hearts that
love in hearts that love, as parts in the whole. If
we are Christians, He is in us, as life in every vein,
as the fruit-producing sap and energy of the vine
is in every branch, as the air in every lung, as the
sunlight in every planet.</p>

<p>This is the deepest mystery of the Christian life.
To be &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; is to be complete. &ldquo;In Him&rdquo;
we are &ldquo;blessed with all spiritual blessings.&rdquo; &ldquo;In
Him&rdquo;, we are &ldquo;chosen,&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him,&rdquo; God &ldquo;freely
bestows His grace upon us.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him&rdquo; we &ldquo;have
redemption through His blood.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him&rdquo; &ldquo;all
things in heaven and earth are gathered.&rdquo; &ldquo;In
Him we have obtained an inheritance.&rdquo; In Him is
the better life of all who live. In Him we have
peace though the world be seething with change
and storm. In Him we conquer though earth and
our own evil be all in arms against us. If we live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in Him, we live in purity and joy. If we die in
Him, we die in tranquil trust. If our gravestones
may truly carry the sweet old inscription carved on
so many a nameless slab in the catacombs, &ldquo;In
Christo,&rdquo; they will also bear the other &ldquo;In pace&rdquo;
(In peace). If we sleep in Him, our glory is
assured, for them also that sleep in Jesus, will God
bring with Him.</p>

<p>III. A word or two only can be devoted to the
last clause of salutation, the apostolic wish, which
sets forth the high ideal to be desired for Churches
and individuals: &ldquo;Grace be unto and peace from
God our Father.&rdquo; The Authorized Version reads,
&ldquo;and the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; but the Revised
Version follows the majority of recent text-critics
and their principal authorities in omitting these
words, which are supposed to have been imported
into our passage from the parallel place in Ephesians.
The omission of these familiar words which occur so
uniformly in the similar introductory salutations of
Paul&#8217;s other epistles, is especially singular here,
where the main subject of the letter is the office of
Christ as channel of all blessings. Perhaps the previous
word, &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; was lingering in his mind,
and so instinctively he stopped with the kindred
word &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace and peace&rdquo;&mdash;Paul&#8217;s wishes for those
whom he loves, and the blessings which he expects
every Christian to possess, blend the Western and
the Eastern forms of salutation, and surpass both.
All that the Greek meant by his &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; all that
the Hebrew meant by his &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; the ideally
happy condition which differing nations have placed
in different blessings, and which all loving words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have vainly wished for dear ones, is secured and
conveyed to every poor soul that trusts in Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace&rdquo;&mdash;what is that? The word means first&mdash;love
in exercise to those who are below the lover,
or who deserve something else; stooping love that
condescends, and patient love that forgives. Then
it means the gifts which such love bestows, and
then it means the effects of these gifts in the beauties
of character and conduct developed in the receivers.
So there are here invoked, or we may call it, proffered
and promised, to every believing heart, the love
and gentleness of that Father whose love to us sinful
atoms is a miracle of lowliness and longsuffering;
and, next, the outcome of that love which never
visits the soul emptyhanded, in all varied spiritual
gifts, to strengthen weakness, to enlighten ignorance,
to fill the whole being; and as last result of all,
every beauty of mind, heart, and temper which can
adorn the character, and refine a man into the likeness
of God. That great gift will come in continuous
bestowment if we are &ldquo;saints in Christ.&rdquo; Of
His fulness we all receive and grace for grace, wave
upon wave as the ripples press shoreward and each
in turn pours its tribute on the beach, or as pulsation
after pulsation makes one golden beam of unbroken
light, strong winged enough to come all the way
from the sun, gentle enough to fall on the sensitive
eyeball without pain. That one beam will decompose
into all colours and brightnesses. That one
&ldquo;grace&rdquo; will part into sevenfold gifts and be the
life in us of whatsoever things are lovely and of
good report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace be unto you.&rdquo; That old greeting, the
witness of a state of society when every stranger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
seen across the desert was probably an enemy, is
also a witness to the deep unrest of the heart. It is
well to learn the lesson that peace comes after grace,
that for tranquillity of soul we must go to God, and
that He gives it by giving us His love and its gifts,
of which, and of which only, peace is the result. If
we have that grace for ours, as we all may if we will,
we shall be still, because our desires are satisfied and
all our needs met. To seek is unnecessary when we
are conscious of possessing. We may end our weary
quest, like the dove when it had found the green leaf,
though little dry land may be seen as yet, and fold
our wings and rest by the cross. We may be lapped
in calm repose, even in the midst of toil and strife,
like John resting on the heart of his Lord. There
must be first of all, peace <i>with</i> God, that there may
be peace <i>from</i> God. Then, when we have been won
from our alienation and enmity by the power of the
cross, and have learned to know that God is our
Lover, Friend and Father, we shall possess the peace
of those whose hearts have found their home, the
peace of spirits no longer at war within&mdash;conscience
and choice tearing them asunder in their strife, the
peace of obedience which banishes the disturbance of
self-will, the peace of security shaken by no fears,
the peace of a sure future across the brightness of
which no shadows of sorrow nor mists of uncertainty
can fall, the peace of a heart in amity with all mankind.
So living in peace, we shall lay ourselves
down and die in peace, and enter into &ldquo;that country,
afar beyond the stars,&rdquo; where &ldquo;grows the flower of
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Rose that cannot wither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fortress and thy ease.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
All this may be ours. Paul could only wish it
for these Colossians. We can only long for it for
our dearest. No man can fulfil his wishes or turn
them into actual gifts. Many precious things we
can give, but not peace. But our brother, Jesus
Christ, can do more than wish it. He can bestow
it, and when we need it most, He stands ever beside
us, in our weakness and unrest, with His strong arm
stretched out to help, and on His calm lips the old
words&mdash;&ldquo;My grace is sufficient for thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;My peace
I give unto you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us keep ourselves in Him, believing in Him
and yielding ourselves to God for His dear sake, and
we shall find His grace ever flowing into our emptiness
and His settled &ldquo;peace keeping our hearts and
minds in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This long introductory section may at first
sight give the impression of confusion, from the
variety of subjects introduced. But a little thought
about it shows it to be really a remarkable specimen
of the Apostle&#8217;s delicate tact, born of his love and
earnestness. Its purpose is to prepare a favourable
reception for his warnings and arguments against
errors which had crept in, and in his judgment were
threatening to sweep away the Colossian Christians
from their allegiance to Christ, and their faith in the
gospel as it had been originally preached to them
by Epaphras. That design explains the selection of
topics in these verses, and their weaving together.</p>

<p>Before he warns and rebukes, Paul begins by
giving the Colossians credit for all the good which
he can find in them. As soon as he opens his mouth,
he asserts the claims and authority, the truth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
power of the gospel which he preaches, and from
which all this good in them had come, and which
had proved that it came from God by its diffusiveness
and fruitfulness. He reminds them of their
beginnings in the Christian life, with which this new
teaching was utterly inconsistent, and he flings his
shield over Epaphras, their first teacher, whose words
were in danger of being neglected now for newer
voices with other messages.</p>

<p>Thus skilfully and lovingly these verses touch a
prelude which naturally prepares for the theme of
the epistle. Remonstrance and rebuke would more
often be effective if they oftener began with showing
the rebuker&#8217;s love, and with frank acknowledgment
of good in the rebuked.</p>

<p>I. We have first a thankful recognition of Christian
excellence as introductory to warnings and remonstrances.</p>

<p>Almost all Paul&#8217;s letters begin with similar expressions
of thankfulness for the good that was in the
Church he is addressing. Gentle rain softens the
ground and prepares it to receive the heavier downfall
which would else mostly run off the hard surface.
The exceptions are, 2 Corinthians; Ephesians, which
was probably a circular letter; and Galatians, which
is too hot throughout for such praises. These expressions
are not compliments, or words of course.
Still less are they flattery used for personal ends.
They are the uncalculated and uncalculating expression
of affection which delights to see white patches
in the blackest character, and of wisdom which
knows that the nauseous medicine of blame is most
easily taken if administered wrapped in a capsule of
honest praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
All persons in authority over others, such as
masters, parents, leaders of any sort, may be the
better for taking the lesson&mdash;&ldquo;provoke not your&rdquo;&mdash;inferiors,
dependents, scholars&mdash;&ldquo;to wrath, lest
they be discouraged&rdquo;&mdash;and deal out praise where
you can, with a liberal hand. It is nourishing food
for many virtues, and a powerful antidote to many
vices.</p>

<p>This praise is cast in the form of thanksgiving to
God, as the true fountain of all that is good in men.
How all that might be harmful in direct praise is
strained out of it, when it becomes gratitude to God!
But we need not dwell on this, nor on the principle
underlying these thanks, namely that Christian men&#8217;s
excellences are God&#8217;s gift, and that therefore, admiration
of the man should ever be subordinate to thankfulness
to God. The fountain, not the pitcher filled
from it, should have the credit of the crystal purity
and sparkling coolness of the water. Nor do we
need to do more than point to the inference from
that phrase &ldquo;having <i>heard</i> of your faith,&rdquo; an inference
confirmed by other statements in the letter,
namely, that the Apostle himself had never <i>seen</i> the
Colossian Church. But we briefly emphasize the
two points which occasioned his thankfulness. They
are the familiar two, <i>faith</i> and <i>love</i>.</p>

<p>Faith is sometimes spoken of in the New Testament
as &ldquo;<i>towards</i> Christ Jesus,&rdquo; which describes that
great act of the soul by its direction, as if it were a
going out or flight of the man&#8217;s nature to the true
goal of all active being. It is sometimes spoken of
as &ldquo;<i>on</i> Christ Jesus,&rdquo; which describes it as reposing
on Him as the end of all seeking, and suggests such
images as that of a hand that leans or of a burden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
borne, or a weakness upheld by contact with Him.
But more sweet and great is the blessedness of faith
considered as &ldquo;<i>in</i> Him,&rdquo; as its abiding place and
fortress-home, in union with, and indwelling in whom
the seeking spirit may fold its wings, and the weak
heart may be strengthened to lift its burden cheerily,
heavy though it be, and the soul may be full of tranquillity
and soothed into a great calm. <i>Towards</i>, <i>on</i>,
and <i>in</i>&mdash;so manifold are the phases of the relation
between Christ and our faith.</p>

<p>In all, faith is the same,&mdash;simple confidence, precisely
like the trust which we put in one another.
But how unlike are the objects!&mdash;broken reeds of
human nature in the one case, and the firm pillar of that
Divine power and tenderness in the other, and how
unlike, alas! is the fervency and constancy of the
trust we exercise in each other and in Christ!
&ldquo;Faith&rdquo; covers the whole ground of man&#8217;s relation
to God. All religion, all devotion, everything which
binds us to the unseen world is included in or evolved
from faith. And mark that this faith is, in Paul&#8217;s
teaching, the foundation of love to men and of
everything else good and fair. We may agree or
disagree with that thought, but we can scarcely fail
to see that it is the foundation of all his moral teaching.
From that fruitful source all good will come. From
that deep fountain sweet water will flow, and all
drawn from other sources has a tang of bitterness.
Goodness of all kinds is most surely evolved from
faith&mdash;and that faith lacks its best warrant of reality
which does not lead to whatsoever things are lovely
and of good report. Barnabas was a &ldquo;good man,&rdquo;
because, as Luke goes on to tell us by way of analysis
of the sources of his goodness, he was &ldquo;full of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Holy Ghost,&rdquo; the author of all goodness, &ldquo;and of
faith&rdquo; by which that Inspirer of all beauty of purity
dwells in men&#8217;s hearts. Faith then is the germ of
goodness, not because of anything in itself, but because
by it we come under the influence of the Divine
Spirit whose breath is life and holiness.</p>

<p>Therefore we say to every one who is seeking to
train his character in excellence, begin with trusting
Christ, and out of that will come all lustre and whiteness,
all various beauties of mind and heart. It is
hard and hopeless work to cultivate our own thorns
into grapes, but if we will trust Christ, He will sow
good seed in our field and &ldquo;make it soft with showers
and bless the springing thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As faith is the foundation of all virtue, so it is the
parent of love, and as the former sums up every bond
that knits men to God, so the latter includes all relations
of men to each other, and is the whole law
of human conduct packed into one word. But the
warmest place in a Christian&#8217;s heart will belong to
those who are in sympathy with his deepest self, and
a true faith in Christ, like a true loyalty to a prince,
will weave a special bond between all fellow-subjects.
So the sign, on the surface of earthly relations, of the
deep-lying central fire of faith to Christ, is the fruitful
vintage of brotherly love, as the vineyards bear the
heaviest clusters on the slopes of Vesuvius. Faith in
Christ and love to Christians&mdash;that is the Apostle&#8217;s
notion of a good man. That is the ideal of character
which we have to set before ourselves. Do we desire
to be good? Let us trust Christ. Do we profess
to trust Christ? Let us show it by the true proof&mdash;our
goodness and especially our love.</p>

<p>So we have here two members of the familiar triad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Faith and Love, and their sister Hope is not far off.
We read in the next clause, &ldquo;because of the hope
which is laid up for you in the heavens.&rdquo; The
connection is not altogether plain. Is the hope the
reason for the Apostle&#8217;s thanksgiving, or the reason
in some sense of the Colossians&#8217; love? As far as
the language goes, we may either read &ldquo;We give
thanks ... because of the hope,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the love which
ye have ... because of the hope.&rdquo; But the long
distance which we have to go back for the connection,
if we adopt the former explanation, and other considerations
which need not be entered on here, seem
to make the latter the preferable construction if it
yields a tolerable sense. Does it? Is it allowable
to say that the hope which is laid up in heaven is in
any sense a reason or motive for brotherly love? I
think it is.</p>

<p>Observe that &ldquo;hope&rdquo; here is best taken as meaning
not the emotion, but the object on which the emotion
is fixed; not the faculty, but the thing hoped for; or
in other words, that it is objective not subjective;
and also that the ideas of futurity and security are
conveyed by the thought of this object of expectation
being laid up. This future blessedness, grasped by
our expectant hearts as assured for us, does stimulate
and hearten to all well-doing. Certainly it does not
supply the main reason; we are not to be loving and
good because we hope to win heaven thereby. The
deepest motive for all the graces of Christian character
is the will of God in Christ Jesus, apprehended by
loving hearts. But it is quite legitimate to draw
subordinate motives for the strenuous pursuit of holiness
from the anticipation of future blessedness, and
it is quite legitimate to use that prospect to reinforce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the higher motives. He who seeks to be good only
for the sake of the heaven which he thinks he will
get for his goodness&mdash;if there be any such a person
existing anywhere but in the imaginations of the
caricaturists of Christian teaching&mdash;is not good and
will not get his heaven; but he who feeds his devotion
to Christ and his earnest cultivation of holiness with
the animating hope of an unfading crown will find
in it a mighty power to intensify and ennoble all life,
to bear him up as on angel&#8217;s hands that lift over all
stones of stumbling, to diminish sorrow and dull pain,
to kindle love to men into a brighter flame, and to
purge holiness to a more radiant whiteness. The
hope laid up in heaven is not the deepest reason or
motive for faith and love&mdash;but both are made more
vivid when it is strong. It is not the light at which
their lamps are lit, but it is the odorous oil which
feeds their flame.</p>

<p>II. The course of thought passes on to a solemn
reminder of the truth and worth of that Gospel which
was threatened by the budding heresies of the Colossian
Church.</p>

<p>That is contained in the clauses from the middle
of the fifth verse to the end of the sixth, and is
introduced with significant abruptness, immediately
after the commendation of the Colossians&#8217; faith.
The Apostle&#8217;s mind and heart are so full of the
dangers which he saw them to be in, although
they did not know it, that he cannot refrain from
setting forth an impressive array of considerations,
each of which should make them hold to the gospel
with an iron grasp. They are put with the utmost
compression. Each word almost might be beaten
out into a long discourse, so that we can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
indicate the lines of thought. This somewhat
tangled skein may, on the whole, be taken as the
answer to the question, Why should we cleave to
Paul&#8217;s gospel, and dread and war against tendencies
of opinion that would rob us of it? They are
preliminary considerations adapted to prepare the
way for a patient and thoughtful reception of the
arguments which are to follow, by showing how
much is at stake, and how the readers would be poor
indeed if they were robbed of that great Word.</p>

<p>He begins by reminding them that to that
gospel they owed all <i>their knowledge and hope of
heaven</i>&mdash;the hope &ldquo;whereof ye heard before in the
word of the truth of the gospel.&rdquo; That great word
alone gives light on the darkness. The sole certainty
of a life beyond the grave is built on the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the sole hope of a
blessed life beyond the grave for the poor soul that
has learned its sinfulness is built on the Death of
Christ. Without this light, that land is a land of
darkness, lighted only by glimmering sparks of
conjectures and peradventures. So it is to-day, as
it was then; the centuries have only made more
clear the entire dependence of the living conviction
of immortality on the acceptance of Paul&#8217;s gospel,
&ldquo;how that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, and that He was raised again the third
day.&rdquo; All around us, we see those who reject the
fact of Christ&#8217;s resurrection finding themselves forced
to surrender their faith in any life beyond. They
cannot sustain themselves on that height of conviction,
unless they lean on Christ. The black
mountain wall that rings us poor mortals round
about is cloven in one place only. Through one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
narrow cleft there comes a gleam of light. There
and there only is the frowning barrier passable.
Through that grim cañon, narrow and black, where
there is only room for the dark river to run, bright-eyed
Hope may travel, letting our her golden thread
as she goes, to guide us. Christ has cloven the
rock, &ldquo;the Breaker has gone up before&rdquo; us, and by
His resurrection alone we have the knowledge which
is certitude, and the hope which is confidence, of an
inheritance in light. If Paul&#8217;s gospel goes, that
goes like morning mist. Before you throw away
the &ldquo;word of the truth of the gospel,&rdquo; at all events
understand that you fling away all assurance of a
future life along with it.</p>

<p>Then, there is another motive touched in these
words just quoted. The gospel is a word of which
the whole substance and content is truth. You may
say that is the whole question, whether the gospel is
such a word? Of course it is; but observe how
here, at the very outset, the gospel is represented as
having a distinct dogmatic element in it. It is of
value, not because it feeds sentiment or regulates
conduct only, but first and foremost because it gives
us true though incomplete knowledge concerning all
the deepest things of God and man about which,
but for its light, we know nothing. That truthful
word is opposed to the argumentations and speculations
and errors of the heretics. The gospel is not
speculation but fact. It is truth, because it is the
record of a Person who is the Truth. The history
of His life and death is the one source of all
certainty and knowledge with regard to man&#8217;s
relations to God, and God&#8217;s loving purposes to man.
To leave it and Him of whom it speaks in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to listen to men who spin theories out of their own
brains is to prefer will-o&#8217;-the-wisps to the sun. If
we listen to Christ, we have the truth; if we turn
from Him, our ears are stunned by a Babel. &ldquo;To
whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of
eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further, this gospel had been already received by
them. Ye <i>heard before</i>, says he, and again he speaks
of the gospel as &ldquo;come unto&rdquo; them, and reminds
them of the past days in which they &ldquo;heard and
knew the grace of God.&rdquo; That appeal is, of course,
no argument except to a man who admits the truth
of what he had already received, nor is it meant for
argument with others, but it is equivalent to the
exhortation, &ldquo;You have heard that word and accepted
it, see that your future be consistent with your past.&rdquo;
He would have the life a harmonious whole, all in
accordance with the first glad grasp which they had
laid on the truth. Sweet and calm and noble is the
life which preserves to its close the convictions of its
beginning, only deepened and expanded. Blessed
are they whose creed at last can be spoken in the
lessons they learned in childhood, to which experience
has but given new meaning! Blessed they who have
been able to store the treasure of a life&#8217;s thought and
learning in the vessels of the early words, which have
grown like the magic coffers in a fairy tale, to hold
all the increased wealth that can be lodged in them!
Beautiful is it when the little children and the young
men and the fathers possess the one faith, and when
he who began as a child, &ldquo;knowing the Father,&rdquo; ends
as an old man with the same knowledge of the same
God, only apprehended now in a form which has
gained majesty from the fleeting years, as &ldquo;Him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that is from the beginning.&rdquo; There is no need to
leave the Word long since heard in order to get
novelty. It will open out into all new depths, and
blaze in new radiance as men grow. It will give new
answers as the years ask new questions. Each epoch
of individual experience, and each phase of society,
and all changing forms of opinion will find what
meets them in the gospel as it is in Jesus. It is
good for Christian men often to recall the beginnings
of their faith, to live over again their early emotions,
and when they may be getting stunned with the din
of controversy, and confused as to the relative importance
of different parts of Christian truth, to remember
<i>what</i> it was that first filled their heart with joy
like that of the finder of a hidden treasure, and with
what a leap of gladness they first laid hold of Christ.</p>

<p>That spiritual discipline is no less needful than is
intellectual, in facing the conflicts of this day.</p>

<p>Again, this gospel was filling the world: &ldquo;it is in
all the world bearing fruit, and increasing.&rdquo; There
are two marks of life&mdash;it is fruitful and it spreads.
Of course such words are not to be construed as if
they occurred in a statistical table. &ldquo;All the world&rdquo;
must be taken with an allowance for rhetorical statement;
but making such allowance, the rapid spread
of Christianity in Paul&#8217;s time, and its power to influence
character and conduct among all sorts and conditions
of men, were facts that needed to be accounted for,
if the gospel was not true.</p>

<p>That is surely a noteworthy fact, and one which
may well raise a presumption in favour of the truth
of the message, and make any proposal to cast it aside
for another gospel, a serious matter. Paul is not
suggesting the vulgar argument that a thing must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
true because so many people have so quickly believed
it. But what he is pointing to is a much deeper
thought than that. All schisms and heresies are
essentially local, and partial. They suit coteries and
classes. They are the product of special circumstances
acting on special casts of mind, and appeal to such.
Like parasitical plants they each require a certain
species to grow on, and cannot spread where these
are not found. They are not for all time, but for an
age. They are not for all men, but for a select few.
They reflect the opinions or wants of a layer of society
or of a generation, and fade away. But the gospel
goes through the world and draws men to itself out
of every land and age. Dainties and confections are
for the few, and many of them are like pickled olives
to unsophisticated palates, and the delicacies of one
country are the abominations of another; but everybody
likes bread and lives on it, after all.</p>

<p>The gospel which tells of Christ belongs to all and
can touch all, because it brushes aside superficial
differences of culture and position, and goes straight
to the depths of the one human heart, which is alike
in us all, addressing the universal sense of sin, and
revealing the Saviour of us all, and in Him the
universal Father. Do not fling away a gospel that
belongs to all, and can bring forth fruit in all kinds
of people, for the sake of accepting what can never
live in the popular heart, nor influence more than a
handful of very select and &ldquo;superior persons.&rdquo; Let
who will have the dainties, do you stick to the wholesome
wheaten bread.</p>

<p>Another plea for adherence to the gospel is based
upon its continuous and universal fruitfulness. It
brings about results in conduct and character which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
strongly attest its claim to be from God. That is a
rough and ready test, no doubt, but a sensible and
satisfactory one. A system which says that it will
make men good and pure is reasonably judged of by
its fruits, and Christianity can stand the test. It
did change the face of the old world. It has been
the principal agent in the slow growth of &ldquo;nobler
manners, purer laws&rdquo; which give the characteristic
stamp to modern as contrasted with pre-Christian
nations. The threefold abominations of the old
world&mdash;slavery, war, and the degradation of woman&mdash;have
all been modified, one of them abolished,
and the others growingly felt to be utterly un-Christian.
The main agent in the change has been
the gospel. It has wrought wonders, too, on single
souls; and though all Christians must be too conscious
of their own imperfections to venture on
putting themselves forward as specimens of its
power, still the gospel of Jesus Christ has lifted men
from the dungheaps of sin and self to &ldquo;set them
with princes,&rdquo; to make them kings and priests; has
tamed passions, ennobled pursuits, revolutionised the
whole course of many a life, and mightily works to-day
in the same fashion, in the measure in which we
submit to its influence. Our imperfections are our
own; our good is its. A medicine is not shown to
be powerless, though it does not do as much as is
claimed for it, if the sick man has taken it irregularly
and sparingly. The failure of Christianity to bring
forth full fruit arises solely from the failure of professing
Christians to allow its quickening powers to
fill their hearts. After all deductions we may still
say with Paul, &ldquo;it bringeth forth fruit in all the
world.&rdquo; This rod has budded, at all events; have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
any of its antagonists&#8217; rods done the same? Do not
cast it away, says Paul, till you are sure you have
found a better.</p>

<p>This tree not only fruits, but grows. It is not
exhausted by fruit-bearing, but it makes wood as
well. It is &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;bearing fruit,&rdquo;
and that growth in the circuit of its branches that
spread through the world, is another of its claims
on the faithful adhesion of the Colossians.</p>

<p>Again, they have heard a gospel which reveals the
&ldquo;true grace of God,&rdquo; and that is another consideration
urging to steadfastness.</p>

<p>In opposition to it there were put then, as there
are put to-day, man&#8217;s thoughts, and man&#8217;s requirements,
a human wisdom and a burdensome code.
Speculations and arguments on the one hand, and
laws and rituals on the other, look thin beside the
large free gift of a loving God and the message
which tells of it. They are but poor bony things
to try to live on. The soul wants something more
nourishing than such bread made out of sawdust. We
want a loving God to live upon, whom we can love
because He loves us. Will anything but the gospel
give us that? Will anything be our stay, in all
weakness, weariness, sorrow and sin, in the fight of
life and the agony of death, except the confidence
that in Christ we &ldquo;know the grace of God in truth&rdquo;?</p>

<p>So, if we gather together all these characteristics
of the gospel, they bring out the gravity of the issue
when we are asked to tamper with it, or to abandon
the old lamp for the brand new ones which many
eager voices are proclaiming as the light of the future.
May any of us who are on the verge of the precipice
lay to heart these serious thoughts! To that gospel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
we owe our peace; by it alone can the fruit of lofty
devout lives be formed and ripened; it has filled the
world with its sound, and is revolutionising humanity;
it and it only brings to men the good news and the
actual gift of the love and mercy of God. It is not
a small matter to fling away all this.</p>

<p>We do not prejudge the question of the truth of
Christianity; but, at all events, let there be no mistake
as to the fact that to give it up is to give up
the mightiest power that has ever wrought for the
world&#8217;s good, and that if its light be quenched there
will be darkness that may be felt, not dispelled but
made more sad and dreary by the ineffectual flickers
of some poor rushlights that men have lit, which
waver and shine dimly over a little space for a little
while, and then die out.</p>

<p>III. We have the Apostolic endorsement of Epaphras,
the early teacher of the Colossian Christians.</p>

<p>Paul points his Colossian brethren, finally, to the
lessons which they had received from the teacher
who had first led them to Christ. No doubt his
authority was imperiled by the new direction of
thought in the Church, and Paul was desirous of
adding the weight of his attestation to the complete
correspondence between his own teaching and that
of Epaphras.</p>

<p>We know nothing about this Epaphras except
from this letter and that to Philemon. He is &ldquo;one
of you,&rdquo; a member of the Colossian Church (iv. 12),
whether a Colossian born or not. He had come
to the prisoner in Rome, and had brought the
tidings of their condition which filled the Apostle&#8217;s
heart with strangely mingled feelings&mdash;of joy for
their love and Christian walk (verses 4, 8), and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
anxiety lest they should be swept from their steadfastness
by the errors that he heard were assailing
them. Epaphras shared this anxiety, and during
his stay in Rome was much in thought, and care,
and prayer for them (iv. 12). He does not seem to
have been the bearer of this letter to Colossæ. He
was in some sense Paul&#8217;s fellow-servant, and in
Philemon he is called by the yet more intimate,
though somewhat obscure, name of his fellow-prisoner.
It is noticeable that he alone of all Paul&#8217;s
companions receives the name of &ldquo;fellow-servant,&rdquo;
which may perhaps point to some very special piece
of service of his, or may possibly be only an instance
of Paul&#8217;s courteous humility, which ever delighted
to lift others to his own level&mdash;as if he had said, Do
not make differences between your own Epaphras
and me, we are both slaves of one Master.</p>

<p>The further testimony which Paul bears to him is
so emphatic and pointed as to suggest that it was
meant to uphold an authority that had been attacked,
and to eulogize a character that had been maligned.
&ldquo;He is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf.&rdquo;
In these words the Apostle endorses his teaching,
as a true representation of his own. Probably
Epaphras founded the Colossian Church and did so
in pursuance of a commission given him by Paul.
He &ldquo;also declared to us your love in the Spirit.&rdquo;
As he had truly represented Paul and his message
to them, so he lovingly represented them and their
kindly affection to him. Probably the same people
who questioned Epaphras&#8217; version of Paul&#8217;s teaching
would suspect the favourableness of his report of
the Colossian Church, and hence the double witness
borne from the Apostle&#8217;s generous heart to both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
parts of his brother&#8217;s work. His unstinted praise
is ever ready. His shield is swiftly flung over any
of his helpers who are maligned or assailed. Never
was a leader truer to his subordinates, more tender
of their reputation, more eager for their increased
influence, and freer from every trace of jealousy,
than was that lofty and lowly soul.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful though a faint image which
shines out on us from these fragmentary notices of
this Colossian Epaphras&mdash;a true Christian bishop,
who had come all the long way from his quiet valley
in the depths of Asia Minor, to get guidance about
his flock from the great Apostle, and who bore
them on his heart day and night, and prayed much
for them, while so far away from them. How
strange the fortune which has made his name and
his solicitudes and prayers immortal! How little
he dreamed that such embalming was to be given
to his little services, and that they were to be
crowned with such exuberant praise!</p>

<p>The smallest work done for Jesus Christ lasts for
ever, whether it abide in men&#8217;s memories or no.
Let us ever live as those who, like painters in fresco,
have with swift hand to draw lines and lay on
colours which will never fade, and let us, by humble
faith and holy life, earn such a character from Paul&#8217;s
master. He is glad to praise, and praise from His
lips is praise indeed. If He approves of us as faithful
servants on His behalf, it matters not what others
may say. The Master&#8217;s &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; will outweigh
labours and toils, and the depreciating tongues of
fellow-servants, or of the Master&#8217;s enemies.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE PRAYER.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease
to pray and to make request for you, that ye may be filled with the
knowledge of His will, in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every
good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened
with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all patience
and longsuffering with joy; giving thanks unto the Father.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span>
i. 9&ndash;12 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We have here to deal with one of Paul&#8217;s prayers
for his brethren. In some respects these are
the very topmost pinnacles of his letters. Nowhere
else does his spirit move so freely, in no other parts
are the fervour of his piety and the beautiful simplicity
and depth of his love more touchingly shown. The
freedom and heartiness of our prayers for others
are a very sharp test of both our piety to God and
our love to men. Plenty of people can talk and vow
who would find it hard to pray. Paul&#8217;s intercessory
prayers are the high-water mark of the epistles in
which they occur. He must have been a good man
and a true friend of whom so much can be said.</p>

<p>This prayer sets forth the ideal of Christian character.
What Paul desired for his friends in Colossæ
is what all true Christian hearts should chiefly desire
for those whom they love, and should strive after and
ask for themselves. If we look carefully at these
words we shall see a clear division into parts which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stand related to each other as root, stem, and fourfold
branches, or as fountain, undivided stream, and &ldquo;four
heads&rdquo; into which this &ldquo;river&rdquo; of Christian life &ldquo;is
parted.&rdquo; To be filled with the knowledge of God&#8217;s
will is the root or fountain-source of all. From it
comes a walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing&mdash;the
practical life being the outcome and expression
of the inward possession of the will of God. Then
we have four clauses, evidently co-ordinate, each
beginning with a participle, and together presenting
an analysis of this worthy walk. It will be fruitful
in all outward work. It will be growing in all inward
knowledge of God. Because life is not all doing and
knowing, but is suffering likewise, the worthy walk
must be patient and long-suffering, because strengthened
by God Himself. And to crown all, above
work and knowledge and suffering it must be thankfulness
to the Father. The magnificent massing
together of the grounds of gratitude which follows,
we must leave for future consideration, and pause,
however abruptly, yet not illogically, at the close
of the enumeration of these four branches of the
tree, the four sides of the firm tower of the true
Christian life.</p>

<p>I. Consider the Fountain or Root of all Christian
character&mdash;&ldquo;that ye may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One or two remarks in the nature of verbal exposition
may be desirable. Generally speaking, the
thing desired is the perfecting of the Colossians in
religious knowledge, and the perfection is forcibly
expressed in three different aspects. The idea of
completeness up to the height of their capacity is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
given in the prayer that they may be &ldquo;filled,&rdquo; like
some jar charged with sparkling water to the brim.
The advanced degree of the knowledge desired for
them is given in the word here employed, which is a
favourite in the Epistles of the Captivity, and means
additional or mature knowledge, that deeper apprehension
of God&#8217;s truth which perhaps had become
more obvious to Paul in the quiet growth of his spirit
during his life in Rome. And the rich variety of
forms which that advanced knowledge would assume
is set forth by the final words of the clause, which
may either be connected with its first words, so
meaning &ldquo;filled ... so that ye may abound in ...
wisdom and understanding;&rdquo; or with &ldquo;the knowledge
of His will,&rdquo; so meaning a &ldquo;knowledge which is
manifested in.&rdquo; That knowledge will blossom out
into <i>every kind</i> of &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;understanding,&rdquo;
two words which it is hard to distinguish, but of
which the former is perhaps the more general and
the latter the more special, the former the more
theoretical and the latter the more practical: and
both are the work of the Divine Spirit whose sevenfold
perfection of gifts illuminates with perfect light
each waiting heart. So perfect, whether in regard
to its measure, its maturity, or its manifoldness, is
the knowledge of the will of God, which the Apostle
regards as the deepest good which his love can ask
for these Colossians.</p>

<p>Passing by many thoughts suggested by the words,
we may touch one or two large principles which they
involve. The first is, that the foundation of all
Christian character and conduct is laid in the knowledge
of the will of God. Every revelation of God
is a law. What it concerns us to know is not abstract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
truth, or a revelation for speculative thought,
but God&#8217;s <i>will</i>. He does not show Himself to us in
order merely that we may know, but in order that,
knowing, we may do, and, what is more than either
knowing or doing, in order that we may be. No
revelation from God has accomplished its purpose
when a man has simply understood it, but every
fragmentary flash of light which comes from Him
in nature and providence, and still more the steady
radiance that pours from Jesus, is meant indeed to
teach us how we should think of God, but to do that
mainly as a means to the end that we may live in
conformity with His will. The light is knowledge,
but it is a light to guide our feet, knowledge which
is meant to shape practice.</p>

<p>If that had been remembered, two opposite errors
would have been avoided. The error that was
threatening the Colossian Church, and has haunted
the Church in general ever since, was that of fancying
Christianity to be merely a system of truth to be
believed, a rattling skeleton of abstract dogmas, very
many and very dry. An unpractical heterodoxy
was their danger. An unpractical orthodoxy is as
real a peril. You may swallow all the creeds bodily,
you may even find in God&#8217;s truth the food of very
sweet and real feeling: but neither knowing nor
feeling is enough. The one all-important question
for us is&mdash;does our Christianity <i>work</i>? It is knowledge
of His <i>will</i>, which becomes an ever active force
in our lives! Any other kind of religious knowledge
is windy food; as Paul says, it &ldquo;puffeth up;&rdquo; the
knowledge which feeds the soul with wholesome
nourishment is the knowledge of His <i>will</i>.</p>

<p>The converse error to that of unpractical knowledge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that of an unintelligent practice, is quite as bad.
There is always a class of people, and they are unusually
numerous to-day, who profess to attach no
importance to Christian doctrines, but to put all the
stress on Christian morals. They swear by the
&ldquo;Sermon on the Mount,&rdquo; and are blind to the deep
doctrinal basis laid in that &ldquo;sermon&rdquo; itself, on which
its lofty moral teaching is built. What God hath
joined together, let no man put asunder. Why pit
the parent against the child? why wrench the blossom
from its stem? Knowledge is sound when it moulds
conduct. Action is good when it is based on
knowledge. The knowledge of God is wholesome
when it shapes the life. Morality has a basis which
makes it vigorous and permanent when it rests upon
the knowledge of His will.</p>

<p>Again: Progress in knowledge is the law of the
Christian life. There should be a continual advancement
in the apprehension of God&#8217;s will, from that
first glimpse which saves, to the mature knowledge
which Paul here desires for his friends. The
progress does not consist in leaving behind old
truths, but in a profounder conception of what is
contained in these truths. How differently a Fijian
just saved, and a Paul on earth, or a Paul in heaven,
look at that verse, &ldquo;God so loved the world that
He gave His only begotten Son&rdquo;! The truths
which are dim to the one, like stars seen through a
mist, blaze to the other like the same stars to an eye
that has travelled millions of leagues nearer them,
and sees them to be suns. The law of the Christian
life is continuous increase in the knowledge of the
depths that lie in the old truths, and of their far-reaching
applications. We are to grow in knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the Christ by coming ever nearer to Him,
and learning more of the infinite meaning of our
earliest lesson that He is the Son of God who has
died for us. The constellations that burn in our
nightly sky looked down on Chaldean astronomers,
but though these are the same, how much more is
known about them at Greenwich than was dreamed
at Babylon!</p>

<p>II. Consider the River or Stem of Christian conduct.</p>

<p>The purpose and outcome of this full knowledge
of the will of God in Christ is to &ldquo;walk worthily
of the Lord unto all pleasing.&rdquo; By &ldquo;walk&rdquo; is of
course meant the whole active life; so that the
principle is brought out here very distinctly, that
the last result of knowledge of the Divine will is an
outward life regulated by that will. And the sort
of life which such knowledge leads to, is designated
in most general terms as &ldquo;worthy of the Lord unto
all pleasing,&rdquo; in which we have set forth two aspects
of the true Christian life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worthily of the Lord!&rdquo; The &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; here, as
generally, is Christ, and &ldquo;worthily&rdquo; seems to mean,
in a manner corresponding to what Christ is to us,
and has done for us. We find other forms of the
same thought in such expressions as &ldquo;worthy of the
vocation wherewith ye are called&rdquo; (Eph. iv. 1),
&ldquo;worthily of saints&rdquo; (Rom. xvi. 2), &ldquo;worthy of the
gospel&rdquo; (Phil. i. 27), &ldquo;worthily of God&rdquo; (1 Thess.
ii. 12), in all of which there is the idea of a standard
to which the practical life is to be conformed.
Thus the Apostle condenses into one word all the
manifold relations in which we stand to Christ, and
all the multifarious arguments for a holy life which
they yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
These are mainly two. The Christian should
&ldquo;walk&rdquo; in a manner corresponding to what Christ
has done for him. &ldquo;Do ye thus requite the Lord,
O foolish people, and unwise?&rdquo; was the mournful
wondering question of the dying Moses to his
people, as he summed up the history of unbroken
tenderness and love on the one side, and of disloyalty
almost as uninterrupted on the other. How
much more pathetically and emphatically might the
question be asked of us! We say that we are not
our own, but bought with a price. Then how do
we repay that costly purchase? Do we not requite
His blood and tears, His unquenchable, unalterable
love, with a little tepid love which grudges sacrifices
and has scarcely power enough to influence conduct
at all, with a little trembling faith which but poorly
corresponds to His firm promises, with a little
reluctant obedience? The richest treasure of
heaven has been freely lavished for us, and we
return a sparing expenditure of our hearts and
ourselves, repaying fine gold with tarnished copper,
and the flood of love from the heart of Christ with
a few niggard drops grudgingly squeezed from ours.
Nothing short of complete self-surrender, perfect
obedience, and unwavering unfaltering love can
characterize the walk that corresponds with our profound
obligations to Him. Surely there can be no
stronger cord with which to bind us as sacrifices to
the horns of the altar than the cords of love. This
is the unique glory and power of Christian ethics,
that it brings in this tender personal element to
transmute the coldness of duty into the warmth of
gratitude, so throwing rosy light over the snowy
summits of abstract virtue. Repugnant duties become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
tokens of love, pleasant as every sacrifice made at
its bidding ever is. The true Christian spirit says:
Thou hast given Thyself wholly for me: help me to
yield myself to Thee. Thou hast loved me perfectly:
help me to love Thee with all my heart.</p>

<p>The other side of this conception of a worthy walk
is, that the Christian should act in a manner corresponding
to Christ&#8217;s character and conduct. We
profess to be His by sacredest ties: then we should
set our watches by that dial, being conformed to His
likeness, and in all our daily life trying to do as He
has done, or as we believe He would do if He were
in our place. Nothing less than the effort to tread
in His footsteps is a walk worthy of the Lord. All
unlikeness to His pattern is a dishonour to Him and
to ourselves. It is neither worthy of the Lord, nor
of the vocation wherewith we are called, nor of the
name of saints. Only when these two things are
brought about in my experience&mdash;when the glow of
His love melts my heart and makes it flow down in
answering affection, and when the beauty of His
perfect life stands ever before me, and though it
be high above me, is not a despair, but a stimulus
and a hope&mdash;only then do I &ldquo;walk worthy of the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another thought as to the nature of the life in
which the knowledge of the Divine will should issue,
is expressed in the other clause&mdash;&ldquo;unto all pleasing,&rdquo;
which sets forth the great aim as being to please
Christ in everything. That is a strange purpose
to propose to men, as the supreme end to be ever
kept in view, to satisfy Jesus Christ by their conduct.
To make the good opinion of men our aim is to be
slaves; but to please this Man ennobles us, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
exalts life. Who or what is He, whose judgment of
us is thus all-important, whose approbation is praise
indeed, and to win whose smile is a worthy object
for which to use life, or even to lose it? We should
ask ourselves, Do we make it our ever present object
to satisfy Jesus Christ? We are not to mind about
other people&#8217;s approbation. We can do without
that. We are not to hunt after the good word of
our fellows. Every life into which that craving for
man&#8217;s praise and good opinion enters is tarnished by
it. It is a canker, a creeping leprosy, which eats
sincerity and nobleness and strength out of a man.
Let us not care to trim our sails to catch the shifting
winds of this or that man&#8217;s favour and eulogium, but
look higher and say, &ldquo;With me it is a very small
matter to be judged of man&#8217;s judgment.&rdquo; &ldquo;I appeal
unto Cæsar.&rdquo; He, the true Commander and Emperor,
holds our fate in His hands; we have to please Him
and Him only. There is no thought which will so
reduce the importance of the babble around us, and
teach us such brave and wholesome contempt for
popular applause, and all the strife of tongues, as
the constant habit of trying to act as ever in our
great Taskmaster&#8217;s eye. What does it matter who
praise, if He frowns? or who blame, if His face lights
with a smile? No thought will so spur us to diligence,
and make all life solemn and grand as the
thought that &ldquo;we labour, that whether present or
absent, we may be well pleasing to Him.&rdquo; Nothing
will so string the muscles for the fight, and free us
from being entangled with the things of this life, as
the ambition to &ldquo;please Him who has called us to
be soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Men have willingly flung away their lives for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
couple of lines of praise in a despatch, or for a smile
from some great commander. Let us try to live and
die so as to get &ldquo;honourable mention&rdquo; from our
captain. Praise from His lips is praise indeed. We
shall not know how much it is worth, till the smile
lights His face, and the love comes into His eyes, as
He looks at us, and says, &ldquo;Well done! good and
faithful servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. We have finally the fourfold streams or
branches into which this general conception of Christian
character parts itself.</p>

<p>There are four participial clauses here, which seem
all to stand on one level, and to present an analysis
in more detail of the component parts of this worthy
walk. In general terms it is divided into fruitfulness
in work, increase in knowledge, strength for suffering,
and, as the climax of all, thankfulness.</p>

<p>The first element is&mdash;&ldquo;bearing fruit in every
good work.&rdquo; These words carry us back to what
was said in ver. 6 about the fruitfulness of the
gospel. Here the man in whom that word is
planted is regarded as the producer of the fruit, by
the same natural transition by which, in our Lord&#8217;s
Parable of the Sower, the men in whose hearts the
seed was sown are spoken of as themselves on the
one hand, bringing no fruit to perfection, and on
the other, bringing forth fruit with patience. The
worthy walk will be first manifested in the production
of a rich variety of forms of goodness. All
profound knowledge of God, and all lofty thoughts
of imitating and pleasing Christ, are to be tested at
last by their power to make men good, and that not
after any monotonous type, nor on one side of their
nature only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
One plain principle implied here is that the only
true fruit is goodness. We may be busy, as many
a man in our great commercial cities is busy, from
Monday morning till Saturday night for a long lifetime,
and may have had to build bigger barns for
our &ldquo;fruits and our goods,&rdquo; and yet, in the high
and solemn meaning of the word here, our life may
be utterly empty and fruitless. Much of our work
and of its results is no more fruit than the galls on
the oak-leaves are. They are a swelling from a
puncture made by an insect, a sign of disease, not
of life. The only sort of work which can be called
fruit, in the highest meaning of the word, is that
which corresponds to a man&#8217;s whole nature and
relations; and the only work which does so correspond
is a life of loving service of God, which
cultivates all things lovely and of good report.
Goodness, therefore, alone deserves to be called
fruit&mdash;as for all the rest of our busy lives, they and
their toils are like the rootless, lifeless chaff that
is whirled out of the threshing-floor by every gust.
A life which has not in it holiness and loving
obedience, however richly productive it may be in
lower respects, is in inmost reality blighted and
barren, and is &ldquo;nigh unto burning.&rdquo; Goodness is
fruit; all else is nothing but leaves.</p>

<p>Again: the Christian life is to be &ldquo;fruitful in
<i>every</i> good work.&rdquo; This tree is to be like that in
the apocalyptic vision, which &ldquo;bare twelve manner
of fruits,&rdquo; yielding every month a different sort.
So we should fill the whole circuit of the year with
various holiness, and seek to make widely different
forms of goodness our own. We have all certain
kinds of excellence which are more natural and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
easier for us than others are. We should seek to
cultivate the kind which is hardest for us. The
thorn stock of our own character should bear not
only grapes, but figs too, and olives as well, being
grafted upon the true olive-tree, which is Christ.
Let us aim at this all-round and multiform virtue,
and not be like a scene for a stage, all gay and
bright on one side, and dirty canvas and stretchers
hung with cobwebs on the other.</p>

<p>The second element in the analysis of the true
Christian life is&mdash;&ldquo;increasing in the knowledge of
God.&rdquo; The figure of the tree is probably continued
here. If it fruits, its girth will increase, its branches
will spread, its top will mount, and next year its
shadow on the grass will cover a larger circle.
Some would take the &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; here as the
instrument or means of growth, and would render
&ldquo;increasing by the knowledge of God,&rdquo; supposing
that the knowledge is represented as the rain or the
sunshine which minister to the growth of the plant.
But perhaps it is better to keep to the idea conveyed
by the common rendering, which regards the words
&ldquo;in knowledge&rdquo; as the specification of that region
in which the growth enjoined is to be realized. So
here we have the converse of the relation between
work and knowledge which we met in the earlier
part of the chapter. There, knowledge led to a
worthy walk; here, fruitfulness in good works leads
to, or at all events is accompanied with, an increased
knowledge. And both are true. These two work
on each other a reciprocal increase. All true
knowledge which is not mere empty notions,
naturally tends to influence action, and all true
action naturally tends to confirm the knowledge from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
which it proceeds. Obedience gives insight: &ldquo;If
any man wills to do My will, he shall know of the
doctrine.&rdquo; If I am faithful up to the limits of my
present knowledge, and have brought it all to bear
on character and conduct, I shall find that in the
effort to make my every thought a deed, there have
fallen from my eyes as it were scales, and I see
some things clearly which were faint and doubtful
before. Moral truth becomes dim to a bad man.
Religious truth grows bright to a good one, and
whosoever strives to bring all his creed into practice,
and all his practice under the guidance of his creed,
will find that the path of obedience is the path of
growing light.</p>

<p>Then comes the third element in this resolution
of the Christian character into its component parts&mdash;&ldquo;strengthened
with all power, according to the
might of His glory, unto all patience and longsuffering
with joyfulness.&rdquo; Knowing and doing are
not the whole of life: there are sorrow and suffering
too.</p>

<p>Here again we have the Apostle&#8217;s favourite &ldquo;<i>all</i>,&rdquo;
which occurs so frequently in this connection. As
he desired for the Colossians, <i>all</i> wisdom, unto <i>all</i>
pleasing, and fruitfulness in <i>every</i> good work, so he
prays for <i>all</i> power to strengthen them. Every kind
of strength which God can give and man can receive,
is to be sought after by us, that we may be &ldquo;girded
with strength,&rdquo; cast like a brazen wall all round our
human weakness. And that Divine power is to flow
into us, having this for its measure and limit&mdash;&ldquo;the
might of His glory.&rdquo; His &ldquo;glory&rdquo; is the lustrous
light of His self-revelation; and the far-flashing
energy revealed in that self-manifestation is the immeasurable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
measure of the strength that may be ours.
True, a finite nature can never contain the infinite,
but man&#8217;s finite nature is capable of indefinite expansion.
Its elastic walls stretch to contain the increasing
gift. The more we desire, the more we receive, and
the more we receive, the more we are able to receive.
The amount which filled our hearts to-day should
not fill them to-morrow. Our capacity is at each
moment the working limit of the measure of the
strength given us. But it is always shifting, and
may be continually increasing. The only real limit
is &ldquo;the might of His glory,&rdquo; the limitless omnipotence
of the self-revealing God. To that we may indefinitely
approach, and till we have exhausted
God we have not reached the furthest point to which
we should aspire.</p>

<p>And what exalted mission is destined for this
wonderful communicated strength? Nothing that
the world thinks great: only helping some lone widow
to stay her heart in patience, and flinging a gleam
of brightness, like sunrise on a stormy sea, over some
tempest-tossed life. The strength is worthily employed
and absorbed in producing &ldquo;all patience and
longsuffering with joy.&rdquo; Again the favourite &ldquo;all&rdquo;
expresses the universality of the patience and longsuffering.
Patience here is not merely passive
endurance. It includes the idea of perseverance in
the right course, as well as that of uncomplaining
bearing of evil. It is the &ldquo;steering right onward,&rdquo;
without bating one jot of heart or hope; the temper
of the traveller who struggles forward, though the
wind in his face dashes the sleet in his eyes, and he
has to wade through deep snow. While &ldquo;patience&rdquo;
regards the evil mainly as sent by God, and as making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the race set before us difficult, &ldquo;longsuffering&rdquo; describes
the temper under suffering when considered as
a wrong or injury done by man. And whether we
think of our afflictions in the one or the other light,
God&#8217;s strength will steal into our hearts, if we will,
not merely to help us to bear them with perseverance
and with meekness as unruffled as Christ&#8217;s, but to
crown both graces&mdash;as the clouds are sometimes
rimmed with flashing gold&mdash;with a great light of joy.
That is the highest attainment of all. &ldquo;Sorrowful,
yet always rejoicing.&rdquo; Flowers beneath the snow,
songs in the night, fire burning beneath the water,
&ldquo;peace subsisting at the heart of endless agitation,&rdquo;
cool airs in the very crater of Vesuvius&mdash;all these
paradoxes may be surpassed in our hearts if they
are strengthened with all might by an indwelling
Christ.</p>

<p>The crown of all, the last of the elements of the
Christian character, is thankfulness&mdash;&ldquo;giving thanks
unto the Father.&rdquo; This is the summit of all; and
is to be diffused through all. All our progressive
fruitfulness and insight, as well as our perseverance
and unruffled meekness in suffering, should have a
breath of thankfulness breathed through them. We
shall see the grand enumeration of the reasons for
thankfulness in the next verses. Here we pause
for the present, with this final constituent of the
life which Paul desired for the Colossian Christians.
Thankfulness should mingle with all our
thoughts and feelings, like the fragrance of some
perfume penetrating through the common scentless
air. It should embrace all events. It should be an
operating motive in all actions. We should be
clear-sighted and believing enough to be thankful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
for pain and disappointment and loss. That gratitude
will add the crowning consecration to service and
knowledge and endurance. It will touch our spirits
to the finest of all issues, for it will lead to glad self-surrender,
and make of our whole life a sacrifice of
praise. &ldquo;I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of
God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice.&rdquo;
Our lives will then exhale in fragrance and shoot up
in flashing tongues of ruddy light and beauty, when
kindled into a flame of gratitude by the glow of
Christ&#8217;s great love. Let us lay our poor selves on
that altar, as sacrifices of thanksgiving; for with such
sacrifices God is well-pleased.</p>

<h2><a name="ColIV" id="ColIV"></a>IV.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE FATHER&#8217;S GIFTS THROUGH THE SON.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance
of the saints in light; who delivered us out of the power of darkness,
and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love; in whom
we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> i. 12&ndash;14
(Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We have advanced thus far in this Epistle
without having reached its main subject.
We now, however, are on its verge. The next
verses to those now to be considered lead us into
the very heart of Paul&#8217;s teaching, by which he would
oppose the errors rife in the Colossian Church.
The great passages describing the person and work
of Jesus Christ are at hand, and here we have the
immediate transition to them.</p>

<p>The skill with which the transition is made is
remarkable. How gradually and surely the
sentences, like some hovering winged things, circle
more and more closely round the central light, till
in the last words they touch it, ... &ldquo;the Son of
His love!&rdquo; It is like some long procession heralding
a king. They that go before, cry Hosanna, and
point to him who comes last and chief. The
affectionate greetings which begin the letter, pass
into prayer; the prayer into thanksgiving. The
thanksgiving, as in these words, lingers over and
recounts our blessings, as a rich man counts his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
treasures, or a lover dwells on his joys. The
enumeration of the blessings leads, as by a golden
thread, to the thought and name of Christ, the
fountain of them all, and then, with a burst and a
rush, the flood of the truths about Christ which he
had to give them sweeps through Paul&#8217;s mind and
heart, carrying everything before it. The name of
Christ always opens the floodgates in Paul&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>We have here then the deepest grounds for
Christian thanksgiving, which are likewise the preparations
for a true estimate of the worth of the
Christ who gives them. These grounds of thanksgiving
are but various aspects of the one great
blessing of &ldquo;Salvation.&rdquo; The diamond flashes
greens and purples, and yellows and reds, according
to the angle at which its facets catch the eye.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed, that all these blessings
are the present possession of Christians. The
language of the first three clauses in the verses
before us points distinctly to a definite past act by
which the Father, at some definite point of time,
made us meet, delivered and translated us, while the
present tense in the last clause shows that &ldquo;our
redemption&rdquo; is not only begun by some definite act
in the past, but is continuously and progressively
possessed in the present.</p>

<p>We notice, too, the remarkable correspondence of
language with that which Paul heard when he lay
prone on the ground, blinded by the flashing light,
and amazed by the pleading remonstrance from
heaven which rung in his ears. &ldquo;I send thee to
the Gentiles ... that they may turn from <i>darkness</i>
to <i>light</i>, and from the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive <i>remission of sins</i>, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<i>inheritance</i> among them which are sanctified.&rdquo; All
the principal phrases are there, and are freely
recombined by Paul, as if unconsciously his memory
was haunted still by the sound of the transforming
words heard so long ago.</p>

<p>I. The first ground of thankfulness which all
Christians have is, that they are fit for the inheritance.
Of course the metaphor here is drawn from the
&ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; given to the people of Israel, namely,
the land of Canaan. Unfortunately, our use of
&ldquo;heir&rdquo; and &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; confines the idea to possession
by succession on death, and hence some
perplexity is popularly experienced as to the force
of the word in Scripture. There, it implies possession
by lot, if anything more than the simple
notion of possession; and points to the fact that the
people did not win their land by their own swords,
but because &ldquo;God had a favour unto them.&rdquo; So
the Christian inheritance is not won by our own
merit, but given by God&#8217;s goodness. The words
may be literally rendered, &ldquo;fitted us for the portion
of the lot,&rdquo; and taken to mean the share or portion
which consists in the lot; but perhaps it is clearer,
and more accordant with the analogy of the division
of the land among the tribes, to take them as
meaning &ldquo;for our (individual) share in the broad
land which, as a whole, is the allotted possession
of the saints.&rdquo; This possession belongs to them,
and is situated in the world of &ldquo;light.&rdquo; Such is
the general outline of the thoughts here. The first
question that arises is, whether this inheritance
is present or future. The best answer is that
it is both; because, whatever additions of power
and splendour as yet unspeakable may wait to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
be revealed in the future, the essence of all which
heaven can bring is ours to-day, if we live in the
faith and love of Christ. The difference between
a life of communion with God here and yonder is
one of degree and not of kind. True, there are
differences of which we cannot speak, in enlarged
capacities, and a &ldquo;spiritual body,&rdquo; and sins cast out,
and nearer approach to &ldquo;the fountain itself of
heavenly radiance;&rdquo; but he who can say, while he
walks amongst the shadows of earth, &ldquo;The Lord is
the portion of my inheritance,&rdquo; will neither leave his
treasures behind him when he dies, nor enter on the
possession of a wholly new inheritance, when he
passes into the heavens. But while this is true, it
is also true that that future possession of God
will be so deepened and enlarged that its beginnings
here are but the &ldquo;earnest,&rdquo; of the same nature
indeed as the estate, but limited in comparison as
is the tuft of grass which used to be given to a new
possessor, when set against the broad lands from
which it was plucked. Here certainly the predominant
idea is that of a present fitness for a
mainly future possession.</p>

<p>We notice again&mdash;where the inheritance is situated&mdash;&ldquo;in
the light.&rdquo; There are several possible ways
of connecting that clause with the preceding. But
without discussing these, it may be enough to point
out that the most satisfactory seems to be to regard
it as specifying the region in which the inheritance
lies. It lies in a realm where purity and knowledge
and gladness dwell undimmed and unbounded by an
envious ring of darkness. For these three are the
triple rays into which, according to the Biblical use
of the figure, that white beam may be resolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
From this there follows that it is capable of being
possessed only by <i>saints</i>. There is no merit or
desert which makes men worthy of the inheritance, but
there is a congruity, or correspondence between character
and the inheritance. If we rightly understand
what the essential elements of &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; are, we shall
have no difficulty in seeing that the possession of it
is utterly incompatible with anything but holiness.
The vulgar ideas of what heaven is, hinder people
from seeing how to get there. They dwell upon the
mere outside of the thing, they take symbols for
realities and accidents for essentials, and so it appears
an arbitrary arrangement that a man must
have faith in Christ to enter heaven. If it be a
kingdom of light, then only souls that love the light
can go thither, and until owls and bats rejoice in
the sunshine, there will be no way of being fit for
the inheritance which is light, but by ourselves being
&ldquo;light in the Lord.&rdquo; Light itself is a torture to
diseased eyes. Turn up any stone by the roadside
and we see how unwelcome light is to crawling
creatures that have lived in the darkness till they
have come to love it.</p>

<p>Heaven is God and God is heaven. How can a
soul possess God, and find its heaven in possessing
Him? Certainly only by likeness to Him, and loving
Him. The old question, &ldquo;Who shall stand in the
Holy Place?&rdquo; is not answered in the gospel by
reducing the conditions, or negativing the old reply.
The common sense of every conscience answers, and
Christianity answers, as the Psalmist does, &ldquo;He that
hath clean hands and a pure heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One more step has to be taken to reach the full
meaning of these words, namely, the assertion that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
men who are not yet perfectly pure are already fit
to be partakers of the inheritance. The tense of
the verb in the original points back to a definite act
by which the Colossians were made meet, namely,
their conversion; and the plain emphatic teaching of
the New Testament is that incipient and feeble faith
in Christ works a change so great, that through it
we are fitted for the inheritance by the impartation
of a new nature, which, though it be but as a grain of
mustard seed, shapes from henceforth the very inmost
centre of our personal being. In due time that spark
will convert into its own fiery brightness the whole
mass, however green and smokily it begins to burn.
Not the absence of sin, but the presence of faith working
by love, and longing for the light, makes fitness.
No doubt flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom
of God, and we must put off the vesture of the body
which has wrapped us during the wild weather here,
before we can be fully fit to enter the banqueting
hall; nor do we know how much evil which has
not its seat in the soul may drop away therewith&mdash;but
the spirit is fit for heaven as soon as a man turns
to God in Christ. Suppose a company of rebels,
and one of them, melted by some reason or other, is
brought back to loyalty. He is fit by that inward
change, although he has not done a single act of
loyalty, for the society of loyal subjects, and unfit
for that of traitors. Suppose a prodigal son away
in the far off land. Some remembrance comes over
him of what home used to be like, and of the
bountiful house-keeping that is still there; and though
it may begin with nothing more exalted than an
empty stomach, if it ends in &ldquo;I will arise and go
to my Father,&rdquo; at that instant a gulf opens between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
him and the riotous living of &ldquo;the citizens of that
country,&rdquo; and he is no longer fitted for their company.
He is meet for the fellowship of his father&#8217;s house,
though he has a weary journey before he gets there,
and needs to have his rags changed, and his filth
washed off him, ere he can sit down at the feast.</p>

<p>So whoever turns to the love of God in Christ,
and yields in the inmost part of his being to the
power of His grace, is already &ldquo;light in the Lord.&rdquo;
The true home and affinities of his real self are in
the kingdom of the light, and he is ready for his
part in the inheritance, either here or yonder. There
is no breach of the great law, that character makes
fitness for heaven&mdash;might we not say that character
makes heaven?&mdash;for the very roots of character lie
in disposition and desire, rather than in action. Nor
is there in this principle anything inconsistent with
the need for continual growth in congruity of nature
with that land of light. The light within, if it be
truly there, will, however slowly, spread, as surely
as the grey of twilight brightens to the blaze of
noonday. The heart will be more and more filled
with it, and the darkness driven back more and more
to brood in remote corners, and at last will vanish
utterly. True fitness will become more and more
fit. We shall grow more and more capable of God.
The measure of our capacity is the measure of our
possession, and the measure in which we have
become light, is the measure of our capacity for the
light. The land was parted among the tribes of
Israel according to their strength; some had a wider,
some a narrower strip of territory. So, as there are
differences in Christian character here, there will be
differences in Christian participation in the inheritance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hereafter. &ldquo;Star differeth from star.&rdquo; Some will
blaze in brighter radiance and glow with more fervent
heat because they move in orbits closer to the sun.</p>

<p>But, thank God, we are &ldquo;fit for the inheritance,&rdquo;
if we have ever so humbly and poorly trusted ourselves
to Jesus Christ and received His renewing life
into our spirits. Character alone fits for heaven.
But character may be in germ or in fruit. &ldquo;If any
man be in Christ, he <i>is</i> a new creature.&rdquo; Do we
trust ourselves to Him? Are we trying, with His
help, to live as children of the light? Then we need
not droop or despair by reason of evil that may still
haunt our lives. Let us give it no quarter, for it
diminishes our fitness for the full possession of God;
but let it not cause our tongue to falter in &ldquo;giving
thanks to the Father who made us meet to be partakers
of the inheritance of the saints in light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. The second ground of thankfulness is, the change
of king and country. God &ldquo;delivered us out of the
power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom
of the Son of His love.&rdquo; These two clauses embrace
the negative and positive sides of the same act which
is referred to in the former ground of thankfulness,
only stated now in reference to our allegiance and
citizenship in the present rather than in the future. In
the &ldquo;deliverance&rdquo; there maybe a reference to God&#8217;s
bringing Israel out of Egypt, suggested by the previous
mention of the inheritance, while the &ldquo;translation&rdquo;
into the other kingdom may be an illustration drawn
from the well known practice of ancient warfare, the
deportation of large bodies of natives from conquered
kingdoms to some other part of the conqueror&#8217;s
realm.</p>

<p>We notice then the two kingdoms and their kings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&ldquo;The power of darkness,&rdquo; is an expression found in
Luke&#8217;s Gospel (xxii. 18), and it may be used here
as a reminiscence of our Lord&#8217;s solemn words.
&ldquo;Power&rdquo; here seems to imply the conception of
harsh, arbitrary dominion, in contrast with the gracious
rule of the other kingdom. It is a realm of cruel and
grinding sway. Its prince is personified in an image
that Æschylus or Dante might have spoken. Darkness
sits sovereign there, a vast and gloomy form on
an ebon throne, wielding a heavy sceptre over wide
regions wrapped in night. The plain meaning of
that tremendous metaphor is just this&mdash;that the men
who are not Christians live in a state of subjection
to darkness of ignorance, darkness of misery, darkness
of sin. If I am not a Christian man, that black
three-headed hound of hell sits baying on my doorstep.</p>

<p>What a wonderful contrast the other kingdom and
its King present! &ldquo;The kingdom of&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;the
light,&rdquo; as we are prepared to hear, in order to complete
the antithesis, but&mdash;&ldquo;the Son of His love,&rdquo; who
is the light. The Son who is the object of His love,
on whom it all and ever rests, as on none besides.
He has a kingdom in existence now, and not merely
hoped for, and to be set up at some future time.
Wherever men lovingly obey Christ, there is His
kingdom. The subjects make the kingdom, and we
may to-day belong to it, and be free from all other
dominion because we bow to His. There then sit
the two kings, like the two in the old story, &ldquo;either
of them on his throne, clothed in his robes, at the
entering in of the gate of the city.&rdquo; Darkness and
Light, the ebon throne and the white throne, surrounded
each by their ministers; there Sorrow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Gloom, here Gladness and Hope; there Ignorance
with blind eyes and idle aimless hands, here Knowledge
with the sunlight on her face, and Diligence
for her handmaid; here Sin, the pillar of the gloomy
realm, there Righteousness, in robes so as no fuller
on earth could white them. Under which king, my
brother?</p>

<p>We notice the transference of subjects. The sculptures
on Assyrian monuments explain this metaphor
for us. A great conqueror has come, and speaks to us
as Sennacherib did to the Jews (2 Kings xviii. 31, 32),
&ldquo;Come out to me ... and I will take you away to
a land of corn and wine, that ye may live and not
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we listen to His voice, He will lead away a
long string of willing captives and plant them, not
as pining exiles, but as happy naturalized citizens,
in the kingdom which the Father has appointed for
&ldquo;the Son of His love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That transference is effected on the instant of
our recognising the love of God in Jesus Christ, and
yielding up the heart to Him. We too often speak
as if the &ldquo;entrance ministered at last to&rdquo; a believing
soul &ldquo;into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour,&rdquo;
were its first entrance therein, and forget that we
enter it as soon as we yield to the drawings of Christ&#8217;s
love and take service under the king. The change
then is greater than at death. When we die, we
shall change provinces, and go from an outlying
colony to the mother city and seat of empire, but we
shall not change kingdoms. We shall be under the
same government, only then we shall be nearer the
King and more loyal to Him. That change of king
is the real fitness for heaven. We know little of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
what profound changes death may make, but clearly
a physical change cannot effect a spiritual revolution.
They who are not Christ&#8217;s subjects will not become
so by dying. If here we are trying to serve a King
who has delivered us from the tyranny of darkness,
we may be very sure that He will not lose His subjects
in the darkness of the grave. Let us choose our
king. If we take Christ for our heart&#8217;s Lord, every
thought of Him here, every piece of partial obedience
and stained service, as well as every sorrow and every
joy, our fading possessions and our undying treasures,
the feeble new life that wars against our sins, and
even the very sins themselves as contradictory of
our deepest self, unite to seal to us the assurance,
&ldquo;Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty.
They shall behold the land that is very far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The heart and centre of all occasions for
thankfulness is the Redemption which we receive in
Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness
of our sins.&rdquo; The Authorized Version reads &ldquo;redemption
<i>through His blood</i>,&rdquo; but these words are not
found in the best manuscripts, and are regarded by
the principal modern editors as having been inserted
from the parallel place in Ephesians (i. 7), where
they are genuine. The very heart then of the
blessings which God has bestowed, is &ldquo;redemption,&rdquo;
which consists primarily, though not wholly, in &ldquo;forgiveness
of sins,&rdquo; and is received by us in &ldquo;the
Son of His love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Redemption,&rdquo; in its simplest meaning, is the act
of delivering a slave from captivity by the payment
of ransom. So that it contains in its application to
the effect of Christ&#8217;s death, substantially the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
figure as in the previous clause which spoke of a
deliverance from a tyrant, only that what was there
represented as an act of Power is here set forth as
the act of self-sacrificing Love which purchases our
freedom at a heavy cost. That ransom price is said
by Christ Himself to be &ldquo;His life,&rdquo; and His Incarnation
to have the paying of that price as one of
its two chief objects. So the words added here by
quotation from the companion Epistle are in full
accordance with New Testament teaching; but even
omitting them, the meaning of the clause is unmistakable.
Christ&#8217;s death breaks the chains which bind
us, and sets us free. By it He acquires us for
Himself. That transcendent act of sacrifice has such
a relation to the Divine government on the one
hand, and to the &ldquo;sin of the world,&rdquo; as a whole, on
the other, that by it all who trust in Him are delivered
from the most real penal consequences of sin and
from the dominion of its darkness over their natures.
We freely admit that we cannot penetrate to the
understanding of <i>how</i> Christ&#8217;s death thus avails.
But just because the <i>rationale</i> of the doctrine is
avowedly beyond our limits, we are barred from
asserting that it is incompatible with God&#8217;s character,
or with common justice, or that it is immoral, and
the like. When we know God through and through,
to all the depths and heights and lengths and
breadths of His nature, and when we know man in
like manner, and when, consequently, we know the
relation between God and man as perfectly, and not
till then, we shall have a right to reject the teaching
of Scripture on this matter, on such grounds. Till
then, let our faith lay hold on the fact, though we do
not understand the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of the fact, and cling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to that cross which is the great power of God unto
salvation, and the heart-changing exponent of the
love of Christ which passeth knowledge.</p>

<p>The essential and first element in this redemption
is &ldquo;the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; Possibly some misconception
of the nature of redemption may have been
associated with the other errors which threatened the
Colossian Church, and thus Paul may have been led
to this emphatic declaration of its contents. Forgiveness,
and not some mystic deliverance by initiation
or otherwise from the captivity of flesh and matter,
is redemption. There is more than forgiveness in
it, but forgiveness lies on the threshold; and that
not only the removal of legal penalties inflicted by
a specific act, but the forgiveness of a father. A
sovereign pardons when he remits the sentence which
law has pronounced. A father forgives when the
free flow of his love is unhindered by his child&#8217;s
fault, and he may forgive and punish at the same
moment. The truest &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; of sin is that death
which consists in separation from God; and the
conceptions of judicial pardon and fatherly forgiveness
unite when we think of the &ldquo;remission of sins&rdquo;
as being the removal of that separation, and the
deliverance of heart and conscience from the burden
of guilt and of a father&#8217;s wrath.</p>

<p>Such forgiveness leads to that full deliverance from
the power of darkness, which is the completion of
redemption. There is deep meaning in the fact that
the word here used for &ldquo;forgiveness,&rdquo; means literally,
&ldquo;sending away.&rdquo; Pardon has a mighty power to
banish sin, not only as guilt, but as habit. The
waters of the gulf stream bear the warmth of the
tropics to the icy north, and lave the foot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
glaciers on its coast till they melt and mingle with
the liberating waves. So the flow of the forgiving
love of God thaws the hearts frozen in the obstinacy
of sin, and blends our wills with itself in glad submission
and grateful service.</p>

<p>But we must not overlook the significant words in
which the condition of possessing this redemption is
stated: &ldquo;in Whom.&rdquo; There must be a real living
union with Christ, by which we are truly &ldquo;in Him&rdquo;
in order to our possession of redemption. &ldquo;Redemption
through His blood&rdquo; is not the whole message
of the Gospel; it has to be completed by &ldquo;<i>In Whom</i>
we have redemption through His blood.&rdquo; That real
living union is effected by our faith, and when we
are thus &ldquo;in Him,&rdquo; our wills, hearts, spirits joined
to Him, then, and only then are we borne away
from &ldquo;the kingdom of the darkness&rdquo; and partake of
redemption. We cannot get His gifts without
Himself.</p>

<p>We observe, in conclusion, how redemption
appears here as a present and growing possession.
There is emphasis on &ldquo;we <i>have</i>.&rdquo; The Colossian
Christians had by one definite act in the past been
fitted for a share in the inheritance, and by the same
act had been transferred to the kingdom of Christ.
Already they possess the inheritance, and are in the
kingdom, although both are to be more gloriously
manifested in the future. Here, however, Paul contemplates
rather the reception, moment by moment,
of redemption. We might almost read &ldquo;we are
having,&rdquo; for the present tense seems used on purpose
to convey the idea of a continual communication
from Him to Whom we are to be united by faith.
Daily we may draw what we daily need&mdash;daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
forgiveness for daily sins, the washing of the feet
which even he who has been bathed requires after
each day&#8217;s march through muddy roads, daily bread
for daily hunger, and daily strength for daily effort.
So day unto day may, in our narrow lives, as in the
wide heavens with all their stars, utter speech, and
night unto night show knowledge of the redeeming
love of our Father. Like the rock that followed the
Israelites in the wilderness, according to Jewish
legend, and poured out water for their thirst, His
grace flows ever by our sides and from its bright
waters we may daily draw with joy.</p>

<p>And so let us lay to heart humbly these two
lessons; that all our Christianity must begin with
forgiveness, and that, however far advanced we may
be in the Divine life, we never get beyond the need
for a continual bestowal upon us of God&#8217;s pardoning
mercy.</p>

<p>Many of us, like some of these Colossians, are
ready to call ourselves in some sense followers of
Christ. The speculative side of Christian truth may
have attractions for some of us, its lofty morality for
others. Some of us may be mainly drawn to it by
its comforts for the weary; some may be looking to
it chiefly in hope of a future heaven. But whatever
we are, and however we may be disposed to Christ
and His Gospel, here is a plain message for us; we
must begin by going to Him for pardon. It is not
enough for any of us to find in Him &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; or
even &ldquo;righteousness,&rdquo; for we need &ldquo;redemption&rdquo;
which is &ldquo;forgiveness,&rdquo; and unless He is to us
forgiveness, He will not be either righteousness or
wisdom.</p>

<p>We can climb a ladder that reaches to heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but its foot must be in &ldquo;the horrible pit and miry
clay&rdquo; of our sins. Little as we like to hear it,
the first need for us all is forgiveness. Everything
begins with that. &ldquo;The inheritance of the saints,&rdquo;
with all its wealth of glory, its immortal life and
unfading joys, its changeless security, and its unending
progress deeper and deeper into the light
and likeness of God, is the goal, but the <i>only</i> entrance
is through the strait gate of penitence. Christ will
forgive on our cry for pardon, and that is the first
link of a golden chain unwinding from His hand
by which we may ascend to the perfect possession
of our inheritance in God. &ldquo;Whom He justified,
them,&rdquo; and them only, He will glorify.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE GLORY OF THE SON IN HIS RELATION TO THE
FATHER, THE UNIVERSE AND THE CHURCH.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
for in Him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth,
things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
principalities or powers, all things have been created through Him and
unto Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.
And He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span>
i. 15&ndash;18 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>As has already been remarked, the Colossian
Church was troubled by teachers who had
grafted on Jewish belief many of the strange speculations
about matter and creation which have always
had such a fascination for the Eastern mind. To us,
they are apt to seem empty dreams, baseless and
bewildering; but they had force enough to shake the
early Church to its foundation, and in some forms
they still live.</p>

<p>These teachers in Colossæ seem to have held that
all matter was evil and the seat of sin; that therefore
the material creation could not have come directly
from a good God, but was in a certain sense opposed
to Him, or, at all events, was separated from Him
by a great gulf. The void space was bridged by a
chain of beings, half abstractions and half persons,
gradually becoming more and more material. The
lowest of them had created the material universe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
now governed it, and all were to be propitiated by
worship.</p>

<p>Some such opinions must be presupposed in order
to give point and force to these great verses in which
Paul opposes the solid truth to these dreams, and
instead of a crowd of Powers and angelic Beings, in
whom the effulgence of Deity was gradually darkened,
and the spirit became more and more thickened
into matter, lifts high and clear against that background
of fable, the solitary figure of the one Christ.
He fills all the space between God and man. There
is no need for a crowd of shadowy beings to link
heaven with earth. Jesus Christ lays His hand upon
both. He is the head and source of creation; He is
the head and fountain of life to His Church. Therefore
He is first in all things, to be listened to, loved
and worshipped by men. As when the full moon
rises, so when Christ appears, all the lesser stars with
which Alexandrian and Eastern speculation had
peopled the abysses of the sky are lost in the mellow
radiance, and instead of a crowd of flickering ineffectual
lights there is one perfect orb, &ldquo;and heaven
is overflowed.&rdquo; &ldquo;We see no <i>creature</i> any more save
Jesus only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have outgrown the special forms of error
which afflicted the Church at Colossæ, but the truths
which are here set over against them are eternal, and
are needed to-day in our conflicts of opinion as much
as then. There are here three grand conceptions of
Christ&#8217;s relations. We have Christ and God, Christ
and Creation, Christ and the Church, and, built upon
all these, the triumphant proclamation of His supremacy
over all creatures in all respects.</p>

<p>I. We have the relation of Christ to God set forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in these grand words, &ldquo;the image of the invisible
God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently Paul is here using for his own purposes
language which was familiar on the lips of his antagonists.
We know that Alexandrian Judaism had
much to say about the &ldquo;Word,&rdquo; and spoke of it as
the Image of God: and probably some such teaching
had found its way to Colossæ. An &ldquo;image&rdquo; is a
likeness or representation, as of a king&#8217;s head on a
coin, or of a face reflected in a mirror. Here it is
that which makes the invisible visible. The God
who dwells in the thick darkness, remote from sense
and above thought, has come forth and made Himself
known to man, even in a very real way has
come within the reach of man&#8217;s senses, in the manhood
of Jesus Christ. Where then is there a place
for the shadowy abstractions and emanations with
which some would bind together God and man?</p>

<p>The first thought involved in this statement is,
that the Divine Being in Himself is inconceivable
and unapproachable. &ldquo;No man hath seen God at
any time, nor can see Him.&rdquo; Not only is He beyond
the reach of sense, but above the apprehension of
the understanding. Direct and immediate knowledge
of Him is impossible. There may be, there is,
written on every human spirit a dim consciousness
of His presence, but that is not knowledge. Creatural
limitations prevent it, and man&#8217;s sin prevents it.
He is &ldquo;the King invisible,&rdquo; because He is the
&ldquo;Father of Lights&rdquo; dwelling in &ldquo;a glorious privacy
of light,&rdquo; which is to us darkness because there is
in it &ldquo;no darkness at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, the next truth included here is, that
Christ is the perfect manifestation and image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
God. In Him we have the invisible becoming
visible. Through Him we know all that we know
of God, as distinguished from what we guess or
imagine or suspect of Him. On this high theme, it
is not wise to deal much in the scholastic language
of systems and creeds. Few words, and these
mainly His own, are best, and he is least likely
to speak wrongly who confines himself most to
Scripture in his presentation of the truth. All the
great streams of teaching in the New Testament
concur in the truth which Paul here proclaims.
The conception in John&#8217;s Gospel of the Word which
is the utterance and making audible of the Divine
mind, the conceptions in the Epistle to the Hebrews
of the effulgence or forthshining of God&#8217;s glory, and
the very image, or stamped impress of His substance,
are but other modes of representing the same facts
of full likeness and complete manifestation, which
Paul here asserts by calling the man Christ Jesus,
the image of the Invisible God. The same thoughts
are involved in the name by which our Lord called
Himself, the Son of God; and they cannot be
separated from many words of His, such as &ldquo;he
that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.&rdquo; In Him
the Divine nature comes near to us in a form that
once could be grasped in part by men&#8217;s senses, for
it was &ldquo;that of the Word of life&rdquo; which they saw
with their eyes and their hands handled, and which
is to-day and for ever a form that can be grasped
by mind and heart and will. In Christ we have the
revelation of a God who can be known, and loved,
and trusted, with a knowledge which, though it be
not complete, is real and valid, with a love which is
solid enough to be the foundation of a life, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
trust which is conscious that it has touched rock
and builds secure. Nor is that fact that He is the
revealer of God, one that began with His incarnation,
or ends with His earthly life. From the beginning
and before the creatural beginning, as we shall see
in considering another part of these great verses, the
Word was the agent of all Divine activity, the &ldquo;arm
of the Lord,&rdquo; and the source of all Divine illumination,
&ldquo;the face of the Lord,&rdquo; or, as we have the
thought put in the remarkable words of the Book
of Proverbs, where the celestial and pure Wisdom is
more than a personification though not yet distinctly
conceived as a person, &ldquo;The Lord possessed me in
the beginning of His way. I was by Him as one
brought up&mdash;or as a master worker&mdash;with Him,
and I was daily <i>His</i> delight ... and <i>My</i> delights
were with the sons of men.&rdquo; And after the veils of
flesh and sense are done away, and we see face to
face, I believe that the face which we shall see, and
seeing, shall have beauty born of the vision passing
into our faces, will be the face of Jesus Christ, in
which the light of the glory of God shall shine for
the redeemed and perfected sons of God, even as it
did for them when they groped amid the shows of
earth. The law for time and for eternity is, &ldquo;I have
declared Thy name unto My brethren and will
declare it.&rdquo; That great fathomless, shoreless ocean
of the Divine nature is like a &ldquo;closed sea&rdquo;&mdash;Christ
is the broad river which brings its waters to men, and
&ldquo;everything liveth whithersoever the river cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these brief words on so mighty a matter, I
must run the risk of appearing to deal in unsupported
statements. My business is not so much to try to
prove Paul&#8217;s words as to explain them, and then to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
press them home. Therefore I would urge that
thought, that we depend on Christ for all true knowledge
of God. Guesses are not knowledge. Speculations
are not knowledge. Peradventures, whether
of hope or fear, are not knowledge. What we poor
men need, is a certitude of a God who loves us and
cares for us, has an arm that can help us, and a
heart that will. The God of &ldquo;pure theism&rdquo; is little
better than a phantom, so unsubstantial that you
can see the stars shining through the pale form, and
when a man tries to lean on him for support, it is
like leaning on a wreath of mist. There is nothing.
There is no certitude firm enough for us to find
sustaining power against life&#8217;s trials in resting upon
it, but in Christ. There is no warmth of love enough
for us to thaw our frozen limbs by, apart from Christ.
In Him, and in Him alone, the far off, awful, doubtful
God becomes a God very near, of Whom we are
sure, and sure that He loves and is ready to help
and cleanse and save.</p>

<p>And that is what we each need. &ldquo;My soul crieth
out for God, for the <i>living</i> God.&rdquo; And never will
that orphaned cry be answered, but in the possession
of Christ, in Whom we possess the Father also. No
dead abstractions&mdash;no reign of law&mdash;still less the
dreary proclamation, &ldquo;Behold we know not anything,&rdquo;
least of all, the pottage of material good, will hush
that bitter wail that goes up unconsciously from
many an Esau&#8217;s heart&mdash;&ldquo;My father, my father!&rdquo;
Men will find Him in Christ. They will find Him
nowhere else. It seems to me that the only refuge
for this generation from atheism&mdash;if it is still allowable
to use that unfashionable word&mdash;is the acceptance of
Christ as the revealer of God. On any other terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
religion is rapidly becoming impossible for the cultivated
class. The great word which Paul opposed to
the cobwebs of Gnostic speculation is the word for
our own time with all its perplexities&mdash;Christ is the
Image of the Invisible God.</p>

<p>II. We have the relation of Christ to Creation set
forth in that great name, &ldquo;the firstborn of all creation,&rdquo;
and further elucidated by a magnificent series of
statements which proclaim Him to be agent or
medium, and aim or goal of creation, prior to it in
time and dignity, and its present upholder and bond
of unity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; At first sight,
this name seems to include Him in the great family
of creatures as the eldest, and clearly to treat Him
as one of them, just because He is declared to be in
some sense the first of them. That meaning has
been attached to the words; but it is shown not to
be their intention by the language of the next verse,
which is added to prove and explain the title. It
distinctly alleges that Christ was &ldquo;before&rdquo; all creation,
and that He is the agent of all creation. To insist
that the words must be explained so as to include
Him in &ldquo;creation&rdquo; would be to go right in the teeth
of the Apostle&#8217;s own justification and explanation of
them. So that the true meaning is that He is the
firstborn, in comparison with, or in reference to, all
creation. Such an understanding of the force of the
expression is perfectly allowable grammatically, and
is necessary unless this verse is to be put in violent
contradiction to the next. The same construction
is found in Milton&#8217;s</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Adam, the goodliest man of men since born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sons, the fairest of her daughters, Eve.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
where &ldquo;of&rdquo; distinctly means &ldquo;in comparison with,&rdquo;
and not &ldquo;belonging to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The title implies priority in existence, and supremacy.
It substantially means the same thing as the
other title of &ldquo;the only begotten Son,&rdquo; only that the
latter brings into prominence the relation of the Son
to the Father, while the former lays stress on His
relation to Creation. Further it must be noted, that
this name applies to the Eternal Word and not to
the incarnation of that Word, or to put it in another
form, the divinity and not the humanity of the Lord
Jesus is in the Apostle&#8217;s view. Such is the briefest
outline of the meaning of this great name.</p>

<p>A series of clauses follow, stating more fully the
relation of the firstborn Son to Creation, and so
confirming and explaining the title.</p>

<p>The whole universe is, as it were, set in one class,
and He alone over against it. No language could
be more emphatically all-comprehensive. Four times
in one sentence we have &ldquo;all things&rdquo;&mdash;the whole
universe&mdash;repeated, and traced to Him as Creator
and Lord. &ldquo;In the heavens and the earth&rdquo; is
quoted from Genesis, and is intended here, as there,
to be an exhaustive enumeration of the creation
according to place. &ldquo;Things visible or invisible&rdquo;
again includes the whole under a new principle of
division&mdash;there are visible things in heaven, as sun
and stars, there may be invisible on earth, but
wherever and of whatever sort they are, He made
them. &ldquo;Whether thrones or dominions, or principalities
or powers,&rdquo; an enumeration evidently alluding
to the dreamy speculations about an angelic hierarchy
filling the space between the far off God, and men
immersed in matter. There is a tone of contemptuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
impatience in Paul&#8217;s voice, as he quotes the
pompous list of sonorous titles which a busy fancy
had coined. It is as if he had said, You are being
told a great deal about these angel hierarchies, and
know all about their ranks and gradations. I do
not know anything about them; but this I know,
that if, amid the unseen things in the heavens or the
earth, there be any such, my Lord made them, and
is their master. So he groups together the whole
universe of created beings, actual or imaginary, and
then high above it, separate from it, its Lord and
Creator, its upholder and end, he points to the
majestic person of the only begotten Son of God,
His Firstborn, higher than all the rulers of the earth,
whether human or superhuman.</p>

<p>The language employed brings into strong relief
the manifold variety of relations which the Son
sustains to the universe, by the variety of the
prepositions used in the sentence. The whole sum
of created things (for the Greek means not only
&ldquo;all things,&rdquo; but &ldquo;all things considered as a unity&rdquo;)
was in the original act, created <i>in</i> Him, <i>through</i>
Him, and <i>unto</i> Him. The first of these words, &ldquo;in
Him,&rdquo; regards Him as the creative centre, as it
were, or element in which as in a storehouse or
reservoir all creative force resided, and was in a
definite act put forth. The thought may be parallel
with that in the prologue to John&#8217;s Gospel, &ldquo;In Him
was life.&rdquo; The Word stands to the universe as the
incarnate Christ does to the Church; and as all
spiritual life is in Him, and union to Him is its
condition, so all physical takes its origin within
the depths of His Divine nature. The error of the
Gnostics was to put the act of creation and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
thing created, as far away as possible from God, and
it is met by this remarkable expression, which brings
creation and the creatures in a very real sense within
the confines of the Divine nature, as manifested
in the Word, and asserts the truth of which pantheism
so called is the exaggeration, that all things are in
Him, like seeds in a seed vessel, while yet they are
not identified with Him.</p>

<p>The possible dangers of that profound truth,
which has always been more in harmony with
Eastern than with Western modes of thought, are
averted by the next preposition used, &ldquo;all things
have been created <i>through</i> Him.&rdquo; That presupposes
the full, clear demarcation between creature and
creator, and so on the one hand extricates the
person of the Firstborn of all creation from all risk of
being confounded with the universe, while on the other
it emphasizes the thought that He is the medium
of the Divine energy, and so brings into clear relief
His relation to the inconceivable Divine nature. He
is the image of the invisible God, and accordingly,
<i>through</i> Him have all things been created. The
same connection of ideas is found in the parallel
passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the
words, &ldquo;<i>through</i> Whom also He made the worlds,&rdquo;
stand in immediate connection with &ldquo;being the
effulgence of His glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there remains yet another relation between
Him and the act of creation. &ldquo;<i>For</i> Him&rdquo; they
have been made. All things come from and tend
towards Him. He is the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the ending. All things spring
from His will, draw their being from that fountain,
and return thither again. These relations which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are here declared of the Son, are in more than
one place declared of the Father. Do we face the
question fairly&mdash;what theory of the person of Jesus
Christ explains that fact?</p>

<p>But further, His existence before the whole
creation is repeated, with a force in both the
words, &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; which can scarcely be given in
English. The former is emphatic&mdash;He Himself&mdash;and
the latter emphasizes not only pre-existence,
but absolute existence. &ldquo;He <i>was</i> before all things&rdquo;
would not have said so much as &ldquo;He <i>is</i> before all
things.&rdquo; We are reminded of His own words,
&ldquo;Before Abraham was, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Him all things consist&rdquo; or hold together.
He is the element in which takes place and by
which is caused that continued creation which is the
preservation of the universe, as He is the element
in which the original creative act took place of old.
All things came into being and form an ordered
unity in Him. He links all creatures and forces into
a co-operant whole, reconciling their antagonisms,
drawing all their currents into one great tidal wave,
melting all their notes into music which God can
hear, however discordant it may sometimes sound
to us. He is &ldquo;the bond of perfectness,&rdquo; the key-stone
of the arch, the centre of the wheel.</p>

<p>Such, then, in merest outline is the Apostle&#8217;s
teaching about the Eternal Word and the Universe.
What sweetness and what reverential awe such
thoughts should cast around the outer world and the
providences of life! How near they should bring
Jesus Christ to us! What a wonderful thought
that is, that the whole course of human affairs and
of natural processes is directed by Him who died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
upon the cross! The helm of the universe is held
by the hands which were pierced for us. The Lord
of Nature and the Mover of all things is that Saviour
on whose love we may pillow our aching heads.</p>

<p>We need these lessons to-day, when many teachers
are trying hard to drive all that is spiritual and
Divine out of creation and history, and to set up a
merciless law as the only God. Nature is terrible
and stern sometimes, and the course of events can
inflict crushing blows; but we have not the added
horror of thinking both to be controlled by no will.
Christ is King in either region, and with our elder
brother for the ruler of the land, we shall not lack
corn in our sacks, nor a Goshen to dwell in. We
need not people the void, as these old heretics did,
with imaginary forms, nor with impersonal forces
and laws&mdash;nor need we, as so many are doing to-day,
wander through its many mansions as through
a deserted house, finding nowhere a Person who
welcomes us; for everywhere we may behold our
Saviour, and out of every storm and every solitude
hear His voice across the darkness saying, &ldquo;It is I;
be not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The last of the relations set forth in this
great section is that between Christ and His Church.
&ldquo;He is the head of the body, the Church; who is
the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A parallel is plainly intended to be drawn between
Christ&#8217;s relation to the material creation and to the
Church, the spiritual creation. As the Word of
God before incarnation is to the universe, so is the
incarnate Christ to the Church. As in the former,
He is prior in time and superior in dignity, so is He
in the latter. As in the universe He is source and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
origin of all being, so in the Church He is the
beginning, both as being first and as being origin of
all spiritual life. As the glowing words which described
His relation to creation began with the great
title &ldquo;the Firstborn,&rdquo; so those which describe His
relation to the Church close with the same name in
a different application. Thus the two halves of His
work are as it were moulded into a golden circle,
and the end of the description bends round towards
the beginning.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, we have here first, Christ the head,
and the Church His body. In the lower realm the
Eternal Word was the power which held all things
together, and similar but higher in fashion is the
relation between Him and the whole multitude of
believing souls. Popular physiology regards the
head as the seat of life. So the fundamental idea
in the familiar metaphor, when applied to our Lord
is that of the source of the mysterious spiritual life
which flows from Him into all the members, and is
sight in the eye, strength in the arm, swiftness in the
foot, colour in the cheek, being richly various in its
manifestations but one in its nature, and all His.
The same mysterious derivation of life from Him is
taught in His own metaphor of the Vine, in which
every branch, however far away from the root, lives
by the common life circulating through all, which
clings in the tendrils, and reddens in the clusters,
and is not theirs though it be in them.</p>

<p>That thought of the source of life leads necessarily
to the other, that He is the centre of unity, by Whom
the &ldquo;many members&rdquo; become &ldquo;one body,&rdquo; and the
maze of branches one vine. The &ldquo;head,&rdquo; too,
naturally comes to be the symbol for authority&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
these three ideas of seat of life, centre of unity,
and emblem of absolute power, appear to be those
principally meant here.</p>

<p>Christ is further the <i>beginning</i> to the Church. In
the natural world He was before all, and source of
all. The same double idea is contained in this name,
&ldquo;the Beginning.&rdquo; It does not merely mean the
first member of a series who begins it, as the first
link in a chain does, but it means the power which
causes the series to begin. The root is the beginning
of the flowers which blow in succession through
the plant&#8217;s flowering time, though we may also call
the first flower of the number the beginning. But
Christ is root; not merely the first flower, though
He is also that.</p>

<p>He is head and beginning to His Church by means
of His resurrection. He is the firstborn from the
dead, and His communication of spiritual life to
His Church requires the historical fact of His resurrection
as its basis, for a dead Christ could not be
the source of life; and that resurrection completes
the manifestation of the incarnate Word, by our
faith in which, His spiritual life flows into our spirits.
Unless He has risen from the dead, all His claims
to be anything else than a wise teacher and fair
character crumble into nothing, and to think of Him
as a source of life is impossible.</p>

<p>He is the beginning through His resurrection, too,
in regard of His raising us from the dead. He is the
first-fruits of them that slept, and bears the promise
of a mighty harvest. He has risen from the dead,
and therein we have not only the one demonstration
for the world that there is a life after death, but the
irrefragable assurance to the Church that because He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
lives it shall live also. A dead body and a living
head cannot be. We are knit to Him too closely
for the Fury &ldquo;with the abhorred shears&rdquo; to cut the
thread. He has risen that He might be the firstborn
among many brethren.</p>

<p>So the Apostle concludes that in all things He
is first&mdash;and all things are, that He <i>may</i> be first.
Whether in nature or in grace, that pre-eminence is
absolute and supreme. The end of all the majesty
of creation and of all the wonders of grace is that
His solitary figure may stand clearly out as centre
and lord of the universe, and His name be lifted
high over all.</p>

<p>So the question of questions for us all is, What
think ye of Christ? Our thoughts now have necessarily
been turned to subjects which may have seemed
abstract and remote&mdash;but these truths which we
have been trying to make clear and to present in
their connection, are not the mere terms or propositions
of a half mystical theology far away from our
daily life, but bear most gravely and directly on our
deepest interests. I would fain press on every conscience
the sharp-pointed appeal&mdash;What is this
Christ to us? Is He <i>any</i> thing to us but a name?
Do our hearts leap up with a joyful Amen when
we read these great words of this text? Are we
ready to crown Him Lord of all? Is He our head,
to fill us with vitality, to inspire and to command?
Is He the goal and the end of our individual life?
Can we each say&mdash;I live by Him, in Him, and for
Him?</p>

<p>Happy are we, if we give to Christ the pre-eminence,
and if our hearts set &ldquo;Him first, Him last,
Him midst and without end.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE RECONCILING SON.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For it was the good pleasure <i>of the Father</i> that in Him should all
the fulness dwell; and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself,
having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him,
<i>I say</i>, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens. And
you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil
works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through
death.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> i. 19&ndash;22 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>These words correspond to those which immediately
precede them, inasmuch as they
present the same sequence, and deal with Christ in
His relation to God, to the universe, and to the
Church. The strata of thought are continuous, and
lie here in the same order as we found them there.
There we had set forth the work of the pre-incarnate
Word as well as of the incarnate Christ; here we
have mainly the reconciling power of His cross proclaimed
as reaching to every corner of the universe,
and as culminating in its operations on the believing
souls to whom Paul speaks. There we had the fact
that He was the image of God laid as basis of His
relation to men and creatures; here that fact itself
apprehended in somewhat different manner, namely,
as the dwelling in Him of all &ldquo;fulness,&rdquo; is traced to
its ground in the &ldquo;good pleasure&rdquo; of the Father, and
the same Divine purpose is regarded as underlying
Christ&#8217;s whole reconciling work. We observe, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that all this section with which we have now to deal
is given as the explanation and reason of Christ&#8217;s
pre-eminence. These are the principal links of
connection with the previous words, and having noted
them, we may proceed to attempt some imperfect
consideration of the overwhelming thoughts here
contained.</p>

<p>I. As before, we have Christ in relation to God.
&ldquo;It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him
should all the fulness dwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, we may well suppose from the use of the
word &ldquo;fulness&rdquo; here, which we know to have been
a very important term in later full-blown Gnostic
speculations, that there is a reference to some of the
heretical teachers&#8217; expressions, but such a supposition
is not needed either to explain the meaning, or to
account for the use of the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fulness&rdquo;&mdash;what fulness? I think, although
it has been disputed, that the language of the next
chapter (ii. 9), where we read &ldquo;In Him dwelleth all
the fulness of the Godhead bodily,&rdquo; should settle
that.</p>

<p>It seems most improbable that with two out of
three significant words the same, the ellipse should
be supplied by anything but the third. The meaning
then will be&mdash;the whole abundance, or totality
of Divine powers and attributes. That is, to put it
in homelier words, that all that Divine nature in all
its sweet greatness, in all its infinite wealth of tenderness
and power and wisdom, is embodied in Jesus
Christ. We have no need to look to heavens above
or to earth beneath for fragmentary revelations of
God&#8217;s character. We have no need to draw doubtful
inferences as to what God is from the questionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
teachings of nature, or from the mysteries of human
history with its miseries. No doubt these do show
something of Him to observant hearts, and most to
those who have the key to their meaning by their
faith in a clearer revelation. At sundry times and
in divers manners, God has spoken to the world by
these partial voices, to each of which some syllables
of His name have been committed. But He has put
His whole name in that messenger of a New Covenant
by whom He has finally declared His whole character
to us, even His Son, in whom &ldquo;it was the good
pleasure of the Father that all the fulness should
dwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word rendered &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; implies a permanent
abode, and may have been chosen in order to oppose
a view which we know to have prevailed later, and
may suspect to have been beginning to appear thus
early, namely, that the union of the Divine and the
human in the person of Christ was but temporary.
At all events, emphasis is placed here on the opposite
truth that that indwelling does not end with the
earthly life of Jesus, and is not like the shadowy
and transient incarnations of Eastern mythology or
speculation&mdash;a mere assumption of a fleshly nature
for a moment, which is dropped from the re-ascending
Deity, but that, for evermore, manhood is wedded to
divinity in the perpetual humanity of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And this indwelling is the result of the Father&#8217;s
good pleasure. Adopting the supplement in the
Authorized and Revised Versions, we might read
&ldquo;the Father pleased&rdquo;&mdash;but without making that
change, the force of the words remains the same.
The Incarnation and whole work of Christ are
referred to their deepest ground in the will of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Father. The word rendered &ldquo;pleased&rdquo; implies both
counsel and complacency; it is both pleasure and
good pleasure. The Father determined the work of
the Son, and delighted in it. Caricatures intentional
or unintentional of New Testament teaching have
often represented it as making Christ&#8217;s work the
means of pacifying an unloving God and moving
Him to mercy. That is no part of the Pauline
doctrine. But he, as all his brethren, taught that
the love of God is the cause of the mission of Christ,
even as Christ Himself had taught that &ldquo;God so
loved the world that He sent His Son.&rdquo; On that
Rock-foundation of the will&mdash;the loving will of the
Father, is built the whole work of His Incarnate Son.
And as that work was the issue of His eternal
purpose, so it is the object of His eternal delight.
That is the wonderful meaning of the word which
fell gently as the dove descending on His head, and
lay on His locks wet from His baptism, like a consecrating
oil&mdash;&ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom
<i>I am well pleased</i>.&rdquo; God willed that so He should
be; He delighted that so He was. Through Christ,
the Father purposed that His fulness should be
communicated to us, and through Christ the Father
rejoices to pour His abundance into our emptiness,
that we may be filled with all the fulness.</p>

<p>II. Again, we have here, as before Christ and the
Universe, of which He is not only Maker, Sustainer,
and Lord, but through &ldquo;the blood of His cross&rdquo;
reconciles &ldquo;all things unto Himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably these same false teachers had dreams
of reconciling agents among the crowd of shadowy
phantoms with which they peopled the void. Paul
lifts up in opposition to all these the one Sovereign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Mediator, whose cross is the bond of peace for all
the universe.</p>

<p>It is important for the understanding of these
great words to observe their distinct reference to the
former clauses which dealt with our Lord&#8217;s relation
to the universe as Creator. The same words are
used in order to make the parallelism as close as
may be, &ldquo;Through Him&rdquo; was creation; &ldquo;through
Him&rdquo; is reconciliation. &ldquo;All things&rdquo;&mdash;or as the
Greek would rather suggest, &ldquo;the universe&rdquo;&mdash;all
things considered as an aggregate&mdash;were made and
sustained through Him and subordinated to Him;
the same &ldquo;all things&rdquo; are reconciled. A significant
change in the order of naming the elements of
which these are composed is noticeable. When
creation is spoken of, the order is &ldquo;in the heavens
and upon the earth&rdquo;&mdash;the order of creation; but
when reconciliation is the theme, the order is
reversed, and we read &ldquo;things upon the earth and
things in the heavens&rdquo;&mdash;those coming first which
stand nearest to the reconciling cross, and are first
to feel the power which streams from it.</p>

<p>This obvious intentional correspondence between
these two paragraphs shows us that whatever be the
nature of the &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; spoken of here, it is
supposed to affect not only rational and responsible
creatures who alone in the full sense of the word
can be reconciled, as they only in the full sense of
the word can be enemies, but to extend to <i>things</i>,
and to send its influence through the universe.
The width of the reconciliation is the same as that
of the creation; they are conterminous. That
being the case, &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; here must have a
different shade of meaning when applied to the sum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
total of created things from what it has when
applied to persons. But not only are inanimate
creatures included in the expression; it may
even be made a question whether the whole of
mankind is not excluded from it, not only by the
phrase &ldquo;all <i>things</i>&rdquo; but also from the consideration
that the effect of Christ&#8217;s death on men is the
subject of the following words, which are not an
explanation of this clause, but an addition to it,
introducing an entirely different department of
Christ&#8217;s reconciling work. Nor should we lose sight
of the very significant omission in this section of the
reference to the angelic beings who were named in
the creation section. We hear nothing now about
thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.
The division into &ldquo;visible and invisible&rdquo; is not
reproduced. I suggest the possibility that the
reason may be the intention to represent this
&ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; as taking effect exclusively on the
regions of creation below the angelic and below the
human, while the &ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; properly so called,
which is brought to pass on alienated men is dealt
with first in the following words.</p>

<p>If this be so, then these words refer mainly to
the restitution of the material universe to its primal
obedience, and represent Christ the Creator removing
by His cross the shadow which has passed over
nature by reason of sin. It has been well said,
&ldquo;How far this restoration of universal nature may be
subjective, as involved in the changed perceptions
of man thus brought into harmony with God, and how far it may
have an objective and independent existence, it were vain to
speculate.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Scripture seems to teach that man&#8217;s sin has made
the physical world &ldquo;subject to vanity&rdquo;; for, although
much of what it says on this matter is unquestionably
metaphor only, portraying the Messianic blessings
in poetical language never meant for dogmatic
truth, and although unquestionably physical death
reigned among animals, and storms and catastrophes
swept over the earth long before man or sin were
here, still&mdash;seeing that man by his sin has compelled
dead matter to serve his lusts and to be his
instrument in acts of rebellion against God, making
&ldquo;a league with the stones of the field&rdquo; against his
and their Master&mdash;seeing that he has used earth to
hide heaven and to shut himself out from its glories,
and so has made it an unwilling antagonist to God
and temptress to evil&mdash;seeing that he has actually
polluted the beauty of the world and has stained
many a lovely scene with his sin, making its rivers
run red with blood&mdash;seeing that he has laid
unnumbered woes on the living creatures&mdash;we may
feel that there is more than poetry in the affirmation
that &ldquo;the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together,&rdquo; and may hear a deep truth, the
extent of which we cannot measure, in Milton&#8217;s
majestic lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Disproportioned Sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jarred against Nature&#8217;s chime, and with harsh din<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brake the fair music that all creatures made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their great Lord, whose love their motion swayed.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we have held forth in words, the extent of
which we can measure as little, the counter-hope that
wherever and however any such effect has come to
pass on the material universe, it shall be done away
by the reconciling power of the blood shed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
cross. That reconciling power goes as far as His
creative power. The universe is one, not only because
all created by the one personal Divine Word,
nor because all upheld by Him, but because in ways
to us unknown, the power of the cross pierces its
heights and depths. As the impalpable influences
of the sun bind planets and comets into one great
system, so from Him on His cross may stream out
attractive powers which knit together far off regions,
and diverse orders, and bring all in harmonious unity
to God, who has made peace by the blood shed on
the cross, and has thereby been pleased to reconcile
all things to Himself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And a Priest&#8217;s hand through creation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waveth calm and consecration.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be that the reference to things in heaven
is like the similar reference in the previous verses,
occasioned by some dreams of the heretical teachers.
He may merely mean to say: You speak much
about heavenly things, and have filled the whole
space between God&#8217;s throne and man&#8217;s earth with
creatures thick as the motes in the sunbeam. I
know nothing about them; but this I know, that, if
they are, Christ made them, and that if among them
there be antagonism to God, it can be overcome by the
cross. As to reconciliation proper,&mdash;in the heavens,
meaning by that, among spiritual beings who dwell
in that realm, it is clear there can be no question of
it. There is no enmity among the angels of heaven,
and no place for return to union with God among
their untroubled bands, who &ldquo;hearken to the voice
of His word.&rdquo; But still if the hypothetical form of
the clause and the use of the neuter gender permit
any reference to intelligent beings in the heavens, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
know that to the principalities and powers in heavenly
places the cross has been the teacher of before unlearned
depths in the Divine nature and purposes,
the knowledge of which has drawn them nearer the
heart of God, and made even their blessed union with
Him more blessed and more close.</p>

<p>On no subject is it more necessary to remember
the limitations of our knowledge than on this great
theme. On none is confident assertion more out of
place. The general truth taught is clear, but the
specific applications of it to the various regions of
the universe is very doubtful. We have no source
of knowledge on that subject but the words of
Scripture, and we have no means of verifying or
checking the conclusions we may draw from them.
We are bound, therefore, if we go beyond the general
principle, to remember that <i>it</i> is one thing, and our
reckoning up of what it includes is quite another.
Our inferences have not the certainty of God&#8217;s word.
<i>It</i> comes to us with &ldquo;Verily, verily.&rdquo; <i>We</i> have no
right to venture on more than Perhaps.</p>

<p>Especially is this the case when we have but one
or two texts to build on, and these most general in
their language. And still more, when we find other
words of Scripture which seem hard to reconcile with
them, if pressed to their utmost meaning. In such
a case our wisdom is to recognise that God has not
been pleased to give us the means of constructing a
dogma on the subject, and rather to seek to learn the
lessons taught by the obscurity that remains than
rashly and confidently to proclaim our inferences
from half of our materials as if they were the very
heart of the gospel.</p>

<p>Sublime and great beyond all our dreams, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
may be sure, shall be the issue. Certain as the
throne of God is it that His purposes shall be accomplished&mdash;and
at last this shall be the fact for the
universe, as it has ever been the will of the Father&mdash;&ldquo;Of
Him, and through Him, and to Him are all
things, to whom be glory for ever.&rdquo; To that highest
hope and ultimate vision for the whole creation, who
will not say, Amen? The great sight which the
seer beheld in Patmos is the best commentary on
our text. To him the eternal order of the universe
was unveiled&mdash;the great white throne, a snowy Alp
in the centre; between the throne and the creatures,
the Lamb, through Whom blessing and life passed
outwards to them, and their incense and praise passed
inwards to the throne; and all around the &ldquo;living
creatures,&rdquo; types of the aggregate of creatural life,
the &ldquo;elders,&rdquo; representatives of the Church redeemed
from among men, and myriads of the firstborn of
heaven. The eyes of all alike wait upon that slain
Lamb. In Him they see God in clearest light of
love and gentlest might&mdash;and as they look and learn
and are fed, each according to his hunger, from the
fulness of Christ, &ldquo;every creature which is in heaven,
and on the earth, and under the earth, and such
as are in the sea, and all that are in them,&rdquo; will be
heard saying &ldquo;Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
power, be unto Him, that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. Christ, and His Reconciling Work in the
Church. We have still the parallel kept up between
the reconciling and the creative work of Christ.
As in verse 18 He was represented as the giver of
life to the Church, in a higher fashion than to the
universe, so, and probably with a similar heightening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the meaning of &ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; He is here set
forth as its giver to the Church.</p>

<p>Now observe the solemn emphasis of the description
of the condition of men before that reconciling
work has told upon their hearts. They are
&ldquo;alienated&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;aliens,&rdquo; as if that were their
original condition, but &ldquo;alienated,&rdquo; as having become
so. The same thought that man&#8217;s sin and separation
from God is a fall, something abnormal and
superinduced on humanity, which is implied in
&ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; or restoration to an original concord,
is implied in this expression. &ldquo;And enemies
in your mind&rdquo;&mdash;the seat of the enmity is in that
inner man which thinks, reflects, and wills, and its
sphere of manifestation is &ldquo;in evil works&rdquo; which are
religiously acts of hostility to God because morally
they are bad. We should not read &ldquo;<i>by</i> wicked
works,&rdquo; as the Authorized Version does, for the evil
deeds have not made them enemies, but the enmity
has originated the evil deeds, and is witnessed to by
them.</p>

<p>That is a severe indictment, a plain, rough, and
as it is thought now-a-days, a far too harsh description
of human nature. Our forefathers no doubt
were tempted to paint the &ldquo;depravity of human
nature&rdquo; in very black colours&mdash;but I am very sure
that we are tempted just in the opposite direction.
It sounds too harsh and rude to press home the old-fashioned
truth on cultured, respectable ladies and
gentlemen. The charge is not that of conscious,
active hostility, but of practical want of affection, as
manifested by habitual disobedience or inattention to
God&#8217;s wishes, and by indifference and separation from
Him in heart and mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
And are these not the habitual temper of multitudes?
The signs of love are joy in the company
of the beloved, sweet memories and longings if
parted, eager fulfilment of their lightest wish, a quick
response to the most slender association recalling
them to our thoughts. Have we these signs of love
to God? If not, it is time to consider what temper
of heart and mind towards the most loving of
Hearts and the most unwearied of Givers, is indicated
by the facts that we scarcely ever think of
Him, that we have no delight in His felt presence,
that most of our actions have no reference whatever
to Him and would be done just the same if there
were no God at all. Surely such a condition is
liker hostility than love.</p>

<p>Further, here, as uniformly, God Himself is the
Reconciler. &ldquo;He&rdquo;&mdash;that is, God, not Christ, &ldquo;has
reconciled us.&rdquo; Some, indeed, read &ldquo;ye have been
reconciled,&rdquo; but the preponderance of authority is in
favour of the text as it stands, which yields a sense
accordant with the usual mode of representation.
It is we who are reconciled. It is God who
reconciles. It is we who are enemies. The Divine
patience loves on through all our enmity, and
though perfect love meeting human sin must become
wrath, which is consistent with love, it never
becomes hatred, which is love&#8217;s opposite.</p>

<p>Observe finally the great means of reconciliation:
&ldquo;In the body of His flesh&rdquo;&mdash;that is, of course,
Christ&#8217;s flesh&mdash;God has reconciled us. Why does
the Apostle use this apparently needless exuberance
of language&mdash;&ldquo;the body of His flesh&rdquo;? It may
have been in order to correct some erroneous
tendencies towards a doctrine which we know was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
afterwards eagerly embraced in the Eastern
Churches, that our Lord&#8217;s body was not truly flesh,
but only a phantasm or appearance. It may have
been to guard against risk of confounding it with
His &ldquo;body the Church,&rdquo; spoken of in the 18th
verse, though that supposes a scarcely credible
dulness in his readers. Or it may more naturally
be accounted for as showing how full his own mind
was of the overwhelming wonder of the fact that He,
Whose majesty he has been setting forth in such
deep words, should veil His eternal glories and limit
His far reaching energies within a fleshly body. He
would point the contrast between the Divine dignity
of the Eternal Word, the Creator and Lord of the
universe, and the lowliness of His incarnation. On
these two pillars, as on two solid piers, one on either
continent, with a great gulf between, the Divinity of
Christ on one side, His Manhood on the other, is
built the bridge by which we pass over the river into
the glory.</p>

<p>But that is not all. The Incarnation is not the
whole gospel. The body of His flesh becomes the
means of our reconciliation &ldquo;through death.&rdquo; Christ&#8217;s
death has so met the requirements of the Divine
law that the Divine love can come freely forth, and
embrace and forgive sinful men. That fact is the
very centre of the revelation of God in Christ, the
very secret of His power. He has died. Voluntarily
and of His own love, as well as in obedience
to the Father&#8217;s loving will, He has borne the consequences
of the sin which He had never shared, in
that life of sorrow and sympathy, in that separation
from God which is sin&#8217;s deepest penalty, and of which
the solemn witness comes to us in the cry that rent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the darkness, &ldquo;My God, My God, why hast Thou
forsaken Me?&rdquo; and in that physical death which is
the parable in the material sphere of the true death
of the spirit. We do not know all the incidence of
Christ&#8217;s death. The whole manner of its operation
has not been told us, but the fact has been. It does
not affect the Divine heart. <i>That</i> we know, for
&ldquo;God so loved the world, that He sent His Son.&rdquo;
But it does affect the Divine government. Without
it, forgiveness could not have been. Its influence
extends to all the years before, as to all after, Calvary,
for the fact that Man continued to be after Man had
sinned, was because the whole Divine government from
the first had respect to the sacrifice that was to be, as
now it all is moulded by the merit of the sacrifice that
has been. And in this aspect of the case, the previous
thoughts as to the blood of the cross having power
in the material universe derive a new meaning, if we
regard the whole history of the world as shaped by
Christ&#8217;s sacrifice, and the very continuance of humanity
from the first moment of transgression as possible,
because He was &ldquo;the Lamb slain before the foundation
of the world,&rdquo; whose cross, as an eternal fact in the
Divine purpose, influenced the Divine government
long before it was realized in time.</p>

<p>For us, that wondrous love&mdash;mightier than death,
and not to be quenched by many waters&mdash;is
the one power that can change our alienation to
glad friendship, and melt the frost and hard-ribbed
ice of indifference and dread into love. That, and
that alone, is the solvent for stubborn wills, the
magnet for distant hearts. The cross of Christ is
the key-stone of the universe and the conqueror of
all enmity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
If religion is to have sovereign power in our lives,
it must be the religion built upon faith in the Incarnate
Son of God, who reconciles the world to God
upon His cross. That is the only faith which makes
men love God and binds them to Him with bands
which cannot be broken. Other types of Christianity
are but tepid; and lukewarm water is an
abomination. The one thing that makes us ground
our rebellious arms and say, Lord, I surrender, Thou
hast conquered, is to see in Christ&#8217;s life the perfect
image of God, and in His death the all-sufficient
sacrifice for sin.</p>

<p>What does it avail for us that the far-reaching
power of Christ&#8217;s cross shoots out magnetic forces to
the uttermost verge of the heavens, and binds the
whole universe by silken blood-red cords to God, if
it does not bind me to Him in love and longing?
What does it avail that God is in Christ, reconciling
the world to Himself, if I am unconscious of the
enmity, and careless of the friendship? Each man
has to ask himself, Am I reconciled to God? Has
the sight of His great love on the cross won <i>me</i>,
body and soul, to His love and service? Have I
flung away self-will, pride and enmity, and yielded
myself a glad captive to the loving Christ who died?
His cross draws us, His love beckons us. God
pleads with all hearts. He who has made peace
by so costly means as the sacrifice of His Son, condescends
to implore the rebels to come into amity
with Him, and &ldquo;prays us with much entreaty to
receive the gift.&rdquo; God beseeches us to be reconciled
to Himself.</p>

was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a
minister.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> i. 22, 23 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The Apostle has been sketching in magnificent
outline a vast system, which we may almost
call the scheme of the universe. He has set forth
Christ as its Lord and centre, through Whom all
things at first came into being, and still continue to
be. In parallel manner he has presented Christ as
Lord and Centre of the Church, its lifegiving Head.
And finally he has set forth Christ as the Reconciler
of all discords in heaven and earth, and especially of
that which parts sinful men from God.</p>

<p>And now he shows us here, in the first words of
our text, the purpose of this whole manifestation of
God in Christ to be the presenting of men perfect
in purity, before the perfect judgment of God. He
then appends the condition on which the accomplishment
of this ultimate purpose in each man depends&mdash;namely,
the man&#8217;s continuance in the faith and
hope of the Gospel. That leads him to gather up,
in a series of clauses characterizing the Gospel,
certain aspects of it which constitute subordinate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
motives and encouragements to such stedfastness.
That is, I think, the outline connection of the
words before us, which at first sight seem somewhat
tangled and difficult to unravel.</p>

<p>I. We have then, first, to consider the ultimate
purpose of God in the work of Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To present you holy and without blemish and
unreproveable before Him.&rdquo; It may be a question
whether these words should be connected with &ldquo;now
hath He reconciled,&rdquo; or whether we are to go farther
back in the long paragraph, and make them
dependent on &ldquo;it was the good pleasure of the
Father.&rdquo; The former seems the more natural&mdash;namely,
to see here a statement of the great end
contemplated in our reconciliation to God; which,
indeed, whatever may be the grammatical construction
preferred here, is also, of course, the
ultimate object of the Father&#8217;s good pleasure. In
the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; there is possibly a sacrificial
allusion, as there is unquestionably in its use in
Rom. xii., &ldquo;Present your bodies a living sacrifice&rdquo;;
or there may be another and even more eloquent
metaphor implied, that of the bringing of the bride
to the husband by the friend of the bridegroom.
That lovely figure is found in two instances of the
use of the word in Paul&#8217;s epistle (2 Cor. ii. 2, &ldquo;to
present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,&rdquo; and Eph.
v. 27, &ldquo;that He might present it to Himself a
glorious Church&rdquo;), and possibly in others. It
certainly gives an appropriate and beautiful emblem
here if we think of the presentation of the bride in
virginal beauty and purity to her Lord at that last
great day which is the bridal day of the perfected
Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
There is, however, no need to suppose any
metaphor at all, nor any allusion beyond the
general meaning of the word&mdash;<i>to set in the presence
of</i>. The sacrificial reference is incongruous here,
and the bridal one not indicated by anything in the
context, as it is in the instances just quoted. One
thing is clear, that the reference is to a future
presentation in the day of judgment, as in another
place, where Paul says, &ldquo;He ... shall raise up us
also ... and shall present us&rdquo; (2 Cor. iv. 14).
In the light of that revealing day, His purpose is
that we shall stand &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; that is, devoted to God
and therefore pure&mdash;&ldquo;without blemish,&rdquo; as the
offerings had to be, and &ldquo;unreproveable,&rdquo; against
whom no charge can be brought. These three
express a regular sequence; first, the inward
principle of consecration and devotion to God, then
its visible issue in stainless conduct and character,
and then its last consequence, that in the judgment
of God and of men we shall stand acquitted of
blame, and every accusation drop away from our
dazzling purity, like muddy water from the white
wing of the sea-bird as it soars. And all this moral
perfectness and unblameableness is to be not merely
in the judgment of men, but &ldquo;before Him,&rdquo; the
light of whose &ldquo;pure eyes and perfect judgment&rdquo;
discovers all stains and evils. They must be spotless
indeed who are &ldquo;without fault before the
throne of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such, then, is the grand conception of the ultimate
purpose and issue of Christ&#8217;s reconciling work.
All the lines of thought in the preceding section lead
up to and converge in this peak. The meaning of
God in creation and redemption cannot be fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fathomed without taking into view the future perfecting
of men. This Christian ideal of the possibilities
for men is the noblest vision that can animate our
hopes. Absolute moral purity which shall be recognised
as perfect by the perfect Judge, and a close
approach to God, so as that we shall be &ldquo;before
Him&rdquo; in a manner unknown here&mdash;are hopes as
much brighter than those which any other systems of
belief print on the dim canvass curtain of the future,
as the Christian estimate of man&#8217;s condition apart
from Christ is sadder and darker than theirs.
Christianity has a much more extended scale of
colours than they have. It goes further down into
blackness for the tints with which it paints man as
he is, and further up into flashing glories of splendour
for the gleaming hues with which it paints him as
he may become. They move within narrow limits
of neutral tints. The Gospel alone does not try to
minimise man&#8217;s evil, because it is triumphantly confident
of its power to turn all that evil into good.</p>

<p>Nothing short of this complete purity and blamelessness
satisfies God&#8217;s heart. We may travel back
to the beginning of this section, and connect its first
words with these, &ldquo;It pleased the Father, to present
us holy and spotless and blameless.&rdquo; It delights
Him thus to effect the purifying of sinful souls, and
He is glad when He sees Himself surrounded by
spirits thus echoing His will and reflecting His light.
This is what he longs for. This is what He aims
at in all His working&mdash;to make good and pure men.
The moral interest is uppermost in His heart and in
His doings. The physical universe is but the scaffolding
by which the true house of God may be built.
The work of Christ is the means to that end, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when God has got us, by such lavish expenditure, to
be white like Himself, and can find nothing in us to
condemn, then, and not till then, does He brood
over us satisfied and glad at heart, resting in His
love, and rejoicing over us with singing.</p>

<p>Nor will anything short of this complete purity
exhaust the power of the Reconciling Christ. His
work is like an unfinished column, or Giotto&#8217;s Campanile,
all shining with marbles and alabasters and set
about with fair figures, but waiting for centuries for
the glittering apex to gather its glories into a heaven-piercing
point. His cross and passion reach no
adequate result, short of the perfecting of saints, nor
was it worth Christ&#8217;s while to die for any less end.
His cross and passion have evidently power to effect
this perfect purity, and cannot be supposed to have
done all that is in them to do, until they have done
that with every Christian.</p>

<p>We ought then to keep very clear before us this
as the crowning object of Christianity: not to make
men happy, except as a consequence of holiness; not
to deliver from penalty, except as a means to holiness;
but to make them holy, and being holy, to
set them close by the throne of God. No man
understands the scope of Christianity, or judges it
fairly, who does not give full weight to that as its
own statement of its purpose. The more distinctly
we, as Christians, keep that purpose prominent in
our thoughts, the more shall we have our efforts
stimulated and guided, and our hopes fed, even when
we are saddened by a sense of failure. We have a
power working in us which can make us white as
the angels, pure as our Lord is pure. If it, being
able to produce perfect results, has produced only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
such imperfect ones, we may well ask, where the
reason for the partial failure lies. If we believed
more vividly that the real purpose and use of Christianity
was to make us good men, we should surely
labour more earnestly to secure that end, should take
more to heart our own responsibility for the incompleteness
with which it has been attained in us, and
should submit ourselves more completely to the
operation of the &ldquo;might of the power&rdquo; which worketh
in us.</p>

<p>Nothing less than our absolute purity will satisfy
God about us. Nothing less should satisfy ourselves.
The only worthy end of Christ&#8217;s work for us is to
present us holy, in complete consecration, and without
blemish, in perfect homogeneousness and uniformity
of white purity and unreproveable in manifest innocence
in His sight. If we call ourselves Christians
let us make it our life&#8217;s business to see that
that end is being accomplished in us in some tolerable
and growing measure.</p>

<p>II. We have next set forth the conditions on
which the accomplishment of that purpose depends:
&ldquo;If so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and
stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The condition is, generally speaking, a stedfast
adherence to the Gospel which the Colossians had
received. &ldquo;If ye continue in the faith,&rdquo; means, I suppose,
if ye continue to live in the <i>exercise</i> of your faith.
The word here has its ordinary subjective sense, expressing
the act of the believing man, and there is no need
to suppose that it has the later ecclesiastical objective
sense, expressing the believer&#8217;s creed, a meaning in
which it may be questioned whether the word is ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
employed in the New Testament. Then this continuance
in the faith is further explained as to its
manner, and that first positively, and then negatively.
They are to be grounded, or more picturesquely and
accurately, &ldquo;founded,&rdquo; that is, built into a foundation,
and therefore &ldquo;stedfast,&rdquo; as banded into the firm
rock, and so partaking of its fixedness. Then,
negatively, they are not to be &ldquo;moved away&rdquo;; the
word by its form conveying the idea, that this is a
process which may be continually going on, and in
which, by some force constantly acting from without,
they may be gradually and imperceptibly pushed off
from the foundation&mdash;that foundation is the hope
evoked or held out by the Gospel, a representation
which is less familiar than that which makes the
Gospel itself the foundation, but is substantially
equivalent to it, though with a different colour.</p>

<p>One or two plain lessons may be drawn from
these words. There is an &ldquo;if,&rdquo; then. However
great the powers of Christ and of His work, however
deep the desire and fixed the purpose of God,
no fulfilment of these is possible except on condition
of our habitual exercise of faith. The Gospel does
not work on men by magic. Mind, heart and will
must be exercised on Christ, or all His power to
purify and bless will be of no avail to us. We shall
be like Gideon&#8217;s fleece, dry when the dew is falling
thick, unless we are continually putting forth living
faith. That attracts the blessing and fits the soul
to receive it. There is nothing mystical about the
matter. Common sense tells us, that if a man never
thinks about any truth, that truth will do him no
good in any way. If it does not find its road into
his heart through his mind, and thence into his life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it is all one as if there were no such truth, or as if
he did not believe it. If our creed is made up of
truths which we do not think about, we may just as
well have no creed. If we do not bring ourselves
into contact with the motives which the Gospel
brings to bear on character, the motives will not
mould our character. If we do not, by faith and
meditation, realize the principles which flow from the
truth as it is in Jesus, and obtain the strength
which is stored in Him, we shall not grow by Him
or like Him. No matter how mighty be the
renewing powers of the Gospel wielded by the
Divine Spirit, they can only work on the nature that
is brought into contact with and continues in contact
with them by faith. The measure in which
we trust Jesus Christ will be the measure in which
He helps us. &ldquo;He could do no mighty works
because of their unbelief.&rdquo; He cannot do what He
can do, if we thwart Him by our want of faith.
God will present us holy before Him <i>if</i> we continue
in the faith.</p>

<p>And it must be present faith which leads to
present results. We cannot make an arrangement
by which we exercise faith wholesale once for all,
and secure a delivery of its blessings in small
quantities for a while after, as a buyer may do with
goods. The moment&#8217;s act of faith will bring the
moment&#8217;s blessings; but to-morrow will have to get
its own grace by its own faith. We cannot lay up
a stock for the future. There must be present
drinking for present thirst; we cannot lay in a
reserve of the water of life, as a camel can drink at
a draught enough for a long desert march. The
Rock follows us all through the wilderness, but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have to fill our pitchers day by day. Many
Christians seem to think that they can live on past
acts of faith. No wonder that their Christian
character is stunted, and their growth stopped, and
many a blemish visible, and many a &ldquo;blame&rdquo; to
be brought against them. Nothing but continual
exercise of faith, day by day, moment by moment,
in every duty, and every temptation, will secure the
continual entrance into our weakness of the strength
which makes strong and the purity which makes
pure.</p>

<p>Then again, if we and our lives are to be firm
and stable, we must have a foundation outside of
ourselves on which to rest. That thought is involved
in the word &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; or &ldquo;founded.&rdquo; It
is possible that this metaphor of the foundation is
carried on into the next clause, in which case &ldquo;the
hope of the Gospel&rdquo; would be the foundation.
Strange to make a solid foundation out of so unsubstantial
a thing as &ldquo;hope!&rdquo; That would be
indeed to build a castle on the air, a palace on a
soap-bubble, would it not? Yes, it would, if this
hope were not &ldquo;the hope produced by the Gospel,&rdquo;
and therefore as solid as the ever-enduring Word
of the Lord on which it is founded. But, more
probably, the ordinary application of the figure is
preserved here, and Christ is the foundation, the
Rock, on which builded, our fleeting lives and our
fickle selves may become rock-like too, and every
impulsive and changeable Simon Bar Jonas rise to
the mature stedfastness of a Peter, the pillar of the
Church.</p>

<p>Translate that image of taking Christ for our
foundation into plain English, and what does it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
come to? It means, let our minds find in Him, in
His Word, and whole revealing life, the basis of our
beliefs, the materials for thought; let our hearts
find in Him their object, which brings calmness and
unchangeableness into their love; let our practical
energies take Him as their motive and pattern, their
strength and their aim, their stimulus and their
reward; let all hopes and joys, emotions and desires,
fasten themselves on Him; let Him occupy and
fill our whole nature, and mould and preside over all
our actions. So shall we be &ldquo;founded&rdquo; on Christ.</p>

<p>And so &ldquo;founded,&rdquo; we shall, as Paul here beautifully
puts it, be &ldquo;stedfast.&rdquo; Without that foundation
to give stability and permanence, we never get down
to what abides, but pass our lives amidst fleeting
shadows, and are ourselves transient as they. The
mind whose thoughts about God and the unseen
world are not built on the personal revelation of God
in Christ will have no solid certainties which cannot
be shaken, but, at the best, opinions which cannot
have more fixedness than belongs to human thoughts
upon the great problem. If my love does not rest
on Christ, it will flicker and flutter, lighting now here
and now there, and even where it rests most secure
in human love, sure to have to take wing some day,
when Death with his woodman&#8217;s axe fells the tree
where it nestles. If my practical life is not built on
Him, the blows of circumstance will make it reel and
stagger. If we are not well joined to Jesus Christ,
we shall be driven by gusts of passion and storms
of trouble, or borne along on the surface of the slow
stream of all-changing time like thistle-down on the
water. If we are to be stable, it must be because
we are fastened to something outside of ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that is stable, just as they have to lash a man to the
mast or other fixed things on deck, if he is not to be
washed overboard in the gale. If we are lashed to
the unchangeable Christ by the &ldquo;cords of love&rdquo; and
faith, we too shall, in our degree, be stedfast.</p>

<p>And, says Paul, that Christ-derived stedfastness
will make us able to resist influences that would move
us away from the hope of the Gospel. That process
which their stedfastness would enable the Colossians
successfully to resist, is described by the language of
the Apostle as continuous, and as one which acted
on them from without. Intellectual dangers arose
from false teachings. The ever acting tendencies of
worldliness pressed upon them, and they needed to
make a distinct effort to keep themselves from being
overcome by these.</p>

<p>If we do not take care that imperceptible, steady
pressure of the all-surrounding worldliness, which
is continually acting on us, will push us right off the
foundation without our knowing that we have shifted
at all. If we do not look well after our moorings
we shall drift away down stream, and never
know that we are moving, so smooth is the motion,
till we wake up to see that everything round about
is changed. Many a man is unaware how completely
his Christian faith has gone till some crisis comes
when he needs it, and when he opens the jar there is
nothing. It has evaporated. When white ants eat
away all the inside of a piece of furniture, they leave
the outside shell apparently solid, and it stands till
some weight is laid upon it, and then goes down
with a crash. Many people loose their Christianity
in that fashion, by its being nibbled away in tiny
flakes by a multitude of secretly working little jaws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and they never know that the pith is out of it till they
want to lean on it, and then it gives under them.</p>

<p>The only way to keep firm hold of hope is to
keep fast on the foundation. If we do not wish to
slide imperceptibly away from Him who alone will
make our lives stedfast and our hearts calm with
the peacefulness of having found our All, we must
continuously make an effort to tighten our grasp on
Him, and to resist the subtle forces which, by silent
pressure or by sudden blows, seek to get us off the
one foundation.</p>

<p>III. Then lastly, we have a threefold motive for
adherence to the Gospel.</p>

<p>The three clauses which close these verses seem
to be appended as secondary and subordinate encouragements
to stedfastness, which encouragements
are drawn from certain characteristics of the Gospel.
Of course, the main reason for a man&#8217;s sticking to
the Gospel, or to anything else, is that it is true.
And unless we are prepared to say that we believe it
true, we have nothing to do with such subordinate
motives for professing adherence to it, except to
take care that they do <i>not</i> influence us. And that
one sole reason is abundantly wrought out in this
letter. But then, its truth being established, we
may fairly bring in other subsidiary motives to
reinforce this, seeing that there may be a certain
coldness of belief which needs the warmth of such
encouragements.</p>

<p>The first of these lies in the words, &ldquo;the Gospel,
which ye heard.&rdquo; That is to say, the Apostle would
have the Colossians, in the face of these heretical
teachers, remember the beginning of their Christian
life, and be consistent with that. They had heard it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at their conversion. He would have them recall what
they had heard then, and tamper with no teaching inconsistent
with it. He also appeals to their experience.
&ldquo;Do you remember what the Gospel did for you?
Do you remember the time when it first dawned
upon your astonished hearts, all radiant with heavenly
beauty, as the revelation of a Heart in heaven that
cared for you, and of a Christ Who, on earth, had
died for you? Did it not deliver you from your
burden? Did it not set new hope before you?
Did it not make earth as the very portals of heaven?
And have these truths become less precious because
familiar? Be not moved away from the Gospel
&lsquo;which ye have heard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>To us the same appeal comes. This word has
been sounding in our ears ever since childhood. It
has done everything for some of us, something for
all of us. Its truths have sometimes shone out for
us like suns, in the dark, and brought us strength
when nothing else could sustain us. If they are not
truths, of course they will have to go. But they
are not to be abandoned easily. They are interwoven
with our very lives. To part with them is a
resolution not to be lightly undertaken.</p>

<p>The argument of experience is of no avail to
convince others, but is valid for ourselves. A man
has a perfect right to say, &ldquo;I have heard Him myself,
and I know that this is indeed the Christ, the
Saviour of the world.&rdquo; A Christian may wisely
decline to enter on the consideration of many moot
questions which he may feel himself incompetent to
handle, and rest upon the fact that Christ has saved
his soul. The blind man beat the Pharisees in
logic when he sturdily took his stand on experience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and refused to be tempted to discuss subjects which
he did not understand, or to allow his ignorance to
slacken his grasp of what he did know. &ldquo;Whether
this man be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing
I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;
There was no answering that, so by excommunicating
him they confessed themselves beaten.</p>

<p>A second encouragement to stedfast adherence
to the Gospel lies in the fact that it &ldquo;was preached
in all creation under heaven.&rdquo; We need not be
pedantic about literal accuracy, and may allow that
the statement has a rhetorical colouring. But what
the Apostle means is, that the gospel had spread
so widely, through so many phases of civilisation,
and had proved its power by touching men so
unlike each other in mental furniture and habits,
that it had showed itself to be a word for the whole
race. It is the same thought as we have already
found in verse 6. His implied exhortation is, &ldquo;Be
not moved away from what belongs to humanity
by teachings which can only belong to a class.&rdquo;
All errors are transient in duration and limited in
area. One addresses itself to one class of men,
another to another. Each false, or exaggerated, or
partial representation of religious truth, is congenial
to some group with idiosyncrasies of temperament
or mind. Different tastes like different spiced
meats, but the gospel, &ldquo;human nature&#8217;s daily food,&rdquo;
is the bread of God that everybody can relish, and
which everybody must have for healthy life. What
only a certain class or the men of one generation
or of one stage of culture can find nourishment
in, cannot be meant for all men. But the great
message of God&#8217;s love in Jesus Christ commends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
itself to us because it can go into any corner of
the world, and there, upon all sorts of people, work
its wonders. So we will sit down with the women
and children upon the green grass, and eat of <i>it</i>,
however fastidious people whose appetites have
been spoiled by high-spiced meat, may find it coarse
and insipid. It would feed them too, if they would
try&mdash;but whatever they may do, let us take it as
more than our necessary food.</p>

<p>The last of these subsidiary encouragements to
stedfastness lies in, &ldquo;whereof I Paul was made a
minister.&rdquo; This is not merely an appeal to their
affection for him, though that is perfectly legitimate.
Holy words may be holier because dear lips have
taught them to us, and even the truth of God may
allowably have a firmer hold upon our hearts because
of our love for some who have ministered
it to us. It is a poor commentary on a preacher&#8217;s
work if, after long service to a congregation, his
words do not come with power given to them by
old affection and confidence. The humblest teacher
who has done his Master&#8217;s errand will have some to
whom he can appeal as Paul did, and urge them to
keep hold of the message which he has preached.</p>

<p>But there is more than that in the Apostle&#8217;s
mind. He was accustomed to quote the fact that
he, the persecutor, had been made the messenger of
Christ, as a living proof of the infinite mercy and
power of that ascended Lord, whom his eyes saw on
the road to Damascus. So here, he puts stress on
the fact that he <i>became</i> a minister of the gospel, as
being an &ldquo;evidence of Christianity.&rdquo; The history of
his conversion is one of the strongest proofs of the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
know, he seems to say, what turned me from being
a persecutor into an apostle. It was because I saw
the living Christ, and &ldquo;heard the words of His
mouth,&rdquo; and, I beseech you, listen to no words
which make His dominion less sovereign, and His
sole and all sufficient work on the cross less mighty
as the only power that knits earth to heaven.</p>

<p>So the sum of this whole matter is&mdash;abide in
Christ. Let us root and ground our lives and
characters in Him, and then God&#8217;s inmost desire will
be gratified in regard to us, and He will bring even
us stainless and blameless into the blaze of His
presence. There we shall all have to stand, and
let that all-penetrating light search us through and
through. How do we expect to be then &ldquo;found of
Him in peace, without spot and blameless&rdquo;? There
is but one way&mdash;to live in constant exercise of faith
in Christ, and grip Him so close and sure that the
world, the flesh and the devil cannot make us loosen
our fingers. Then He will hold us up, and His
great purpose, which brought Him to earth, and
nailed Him to the cross, will be fulfilled in us, and
at last, we shall lift up voices of wondering praise
&ldquo;to Him who is able to keep us from falling, and to
present us faultless before the presence of His glory
with exceeding joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are scarcely any personal references in
this Epistle, until we reach the last chapter.
In this respect it contrasts strikingly with another
of Paul&#8217;s epistles of the captivity, that to the
Philippians, which is running over with affection
and with allusions to himself. This sparseness of
personal details strongly confirms the opinion that
he had not been to Colossæ. Here, however, we
come to one of the very few sections which may be
called personal, though even here it is rather Paul&#8217;s
office than himself which is in question. He is led
to speak of himself by his desire to enforce his
exhortations to faithful continuance in the gospel,
and, as is so often the case with him in touching
on his apostleship, he as it were, catches fire, and
blazes up in a grand flame, which sheds a bright
light on his lofty enthusiasm and evangelistic fervour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The words to be considered now are plain enough
in themselves, but they are run together, and thought
follows thought in a fashion which makes them
somewhat obscure; and there are also one or two
difficulties in single words which require to be
cleared up. We shall perhaps best bring out the
course of thought by dealing with these verses in
three groups, of which the three words, Suffering,
Service, and Mystery, are respectively the centres.
First, we have a remarkable view taken by the
prisoner of the meaning of his sufferings, as being
endured for the Church. That leads him to speak of
his relation to the Church generally as being that of
a servant or steward appointed by God, to bring to
its completion the work of God; and then, as I said,
he takes fire, and, forgetting himself, flames up in
rapturous magnifying of the grand message hid so
long, and now entrusted to him to preach. So we
have his Sufferings for the Church, his service of
Stewardship to the Church, and the great Mystery
which in that stewardship he had to unveil. It may
help us to understand both Paul and his message, as
well as our own tasks and trials, if we try to grasp
his thoughts here about his work and his sorrows.</p>

<p>I. We have the Apostle&#8217;s triumphant contemplation
of his sufferings. &ldquo;I rejoice in my sufferings
for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is
lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
His body&#8217;s sake, which is the Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Revised Version, following the best authorities,
omits the &ldquo;who&rdquo; with which the Authorized
Version begins this verse, and marks a new sentence
and paragraph, as is obviously right.</p>

<p>The very first word is significant: &ldquo;<i>Now</i> I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
rejoice.&rdquo; Ay; it is easy to say fine things about
patience in sufferings and triumph in sorrow when
we are prosperous and comfortable; but it is
different when we are in the furnace. This man,
with the chain on his wrist, and the iron entering
into his soul, with his life in danger, and all the
future uncertain, can say, &ldquo;<i>Now</i> I rejoice.&rdquo; This
bird sings in a darkened cage.</p>

<p>Then come startling words, &ldquo;I on my part fill up
that which is lacking (a better rendering than &lsquo;behind&rsquo;)
of the afflictions of Christ.&rdquo; It is not surprising that
many explanations of these words have tried to
soften down their boldness; as, for instance, &ldquo;afflictions
borne for Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;imposed by Him,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;like His.&rdquo; But it seems very clear that the
startling meaning is the plain meaning, and that
&ldquo;the sufferings of Christ&rdquo; here, as everywhere else,
are &ldquo;the sufferings borne by Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then at once the questions start up, Does Paul
mean to say that in any sense whatever the sufferings
which Christ endured have anything &ldquo;lacking&rdquo;
in them? or does he mean to say that a Christian
man&#8217;s sufferings, however they may benefit the
Church, can be put alongside of the Lord&#8217;s, and
taken to eke out the incompleteness of His? Surely
that cannot be! Did He not say on the cross,
&ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;? Surely that sacrifice needs no
supplement, and can receive none, but stands &ldquo;the
one sacrifice for sins for ever&rdquo;! Surely, His
sufferings are absolutely singular in nature and
effect, unique and all-sufficient and eternal. And
does this Apostle, the very heart of whose gospel
was that these were the life of the world, mean to
say that anything which he endures can be tacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
on to them, a bit of the old rags to the new garment?</p>

<p>Distinctly not! To say so would be contradictory
of the whole spirit and letter of the Apostle&#8217;s teaching.
But there is no need to suppose that he means
anything of the sort. There is an idea frequently
presented in Scripture, which gives full meaning to
the words, and is in full accordance with Pauline
teaching; namely, that Christ truly participates in
the sufferings of His people borne for Him. He
suffers with them. The head feels the pangs of all
the members; and every ache may be thought of as
belonging, not only to the limb where it is located,
but to the brain which is conscious of it. The pains
and sorrows and troubles of His friends and followers
to the end of time are one great whole. Each sorrow
of each Christian heart is one drop more added to
the contents of the measure which has to be filled to
the brim, ere the purposes of the Father who leads
through suffering to rest are accomplished; and all
belong to Him. Whatsoever pain or trial is borne
in fellowship with Him is felt and borne by Him.
Community of sensation is established between Him
and us. Our sorrows are transferred to Him. &ldquo;In
all our afflictions He is afflicted,&rdquo; both by His mystical
but most real oneness with us, and by His
brother&#8217;s sympathy.</p>

<p>So for us all, and not for the Apostle only, the
whole aspect of our sorrows may be changed, and all
poor struggling souls in this valley of weeping may
take comfort and courage from the wonderful thought
of Christ&#8217;s union with us, which makes our griefs His,
and our pain touch Him. Bruise your finger, and the
pain pricks and stabs in your brain. Strike the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that is joined to Christ here, and Christ up yonder
feels it. &ldquo;He that toucheth you toucheth the apple
of His eye.&rdquo; Where did Paul learn this deep lesson,
that the sufferings of Christ&#8217;s servants were Christ&#8217;s
sufferings? I wonder whether, as he wrote these
words of confident yet humble identification of himself
the persecuted with Christ the Lord, there came
back to his memory what he heard on that fateful
day as he rode to Damascus, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou Me?&rdquo; The thought so crushing to
the persecutor had become balm and glory to the
prisoner,&mdash;that every blow aimed at the servant falls
on the Master, who stoops from amid the glory of
the throne to declare that whatsoever is done, whether
it be kindness or cruelty, to the least of His brethren,
is done to Him. So every one of us may take the
comfort and strength of that wonderful assurance,
and roll all our burdens and sorrows on Him.</p>

<p>Again, there is prominent here the thought that
the good of sorrow does not end with the sufferer.
His sufferings are borne in his <i>flesh</i> for the <i>body&#8217;s</i>
sake, which is the Church,&mdash;a remarkable antithesis
between the Apostle&#8217;s flesh in which, and Christ&#8217;s
body for which, the sufferings are endured. Every
sorrow rightly borne, as it will be when Christ is felt
to be bearing it with us, is fruitful of blessing. Paul&#8217;s
trials were in a special sense &ldquo;for His body&#8217;s sake,&rdquo;
for of course, if he had not preached the gospel, he
would have escaped them all; and on the other hand,
they have been especially fruitful of good, for if he
had not been persecuted, he would never have written
these precious letters from Rome. The Church owes
much to the violence which has shut up confessors
in dungeons. Its prison literature, beginning with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this letter, and ending with &ldquo;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&rdquo; has
been among its most cherished treasures.</p>

<p>But the same thing is true about us all, though it
may be in a narrower sphere. No man gets good
for himself alone out of his sorrows. Whatever
purifies and makes gentler and more Christlike, whatever
teaches or builds up&mdash;and sorrows rightly borne
do all these&mdash;is for the common good. Be our trials
great or small, be they minute and every-day&mdash;like
gnats that hum about us in clouds, and may be swept
away by the hand, and irritate rather than hurt
where they sting&mdash;or be they huge and formidable,
like the viper that clings to the wrist and poisons
the life blood, they are meant to give us good gifts,
which we may transmit to the narrow circle of our
homes, and in ever widening rings of influence to all
around us. Have we never known a household, where
some chronic invalid, lying helpless perhaps on a
sofa, was a source of the highest blessing and the
centre of holy influence, that made every member of
the family gentler, more self-denying and loving?
We shall never understand our sorrows, unless we
try to answer the question, What good to others is
meant to come through me by this? Alas, that grief
should so often be self-absorbed, even more than joy
is! The heart sometimes opens to unselfish sharing
of its gladness with others; but it too often shuts
tight over its sorrow, and seeks solitary indulgence
in the luxury of woe. Let us learn that our brethren
claim benefit from our trials, as well as from our
good things, and seek to ennoble our griefs by
bearing them for &ldquo;His body&#8217;s sake, which is the
Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s sufferings on His cross are the satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for a world&#8217;s sins, and in that view can have
no supplement, and stand alone in kind. But His
&ldquo;afflictions&rdquo;&mdash;a word which would not naturally be
applied to His death&mdash;do operate also to set the
pattern of holy endurance, and to teach many a
lesson; and in that view every suffering borne for
Him and with Him may be regarded as associated
with His, and helping to bless the Church and the
world. God makes the rough iron of our natures
into shining, flexible, sharp steel, by heavy hammers
and hot furnaces, that He may shape us as His
instruments to help and heal.</p>

<p>It is of great moment that we should have such
thoughts of our sorrows whilst their pressure is upon
us, and not only when they are past. &ldquo;I <i>now</i> rejoice.&rdquo;
Most of us have had to let years stretch
between us and the blow before we could attain to
that clear insight. We can look back and see how
our past sorrows tended to bless us, and how Christ
was with us in them: but as for this one, that
burdens us to-day, we cannot make <i>it</i> out. We can
even have a solemn thankfulness not altogether
unlike joy as we look on those wounds that we
remember; but how hard it is to feel it about those
that pain us now! There is but one way to secure
that calm wisdom, which feels their meaning even
while they sting and burn, and can smile through
tears, as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing; and that
is to keep in very close communion with our Lord.
Then, even when we are in the whitest heat of the
furnace, we may have the Son of man with us; and
if we have, the fiercest flames will burn up nothing
but the chains that bind us, and we shall &ldquo;walk at
liberty&rdquo; in that terrible heat, because we walk with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Him. It is a high attainment of Christian fortitude
and faith to feel the blessed meaning, not only of the
six tribulations which are past, but of the present
seventh, and to say, even while the iron is entering
the quivering flesh, &ldquo;I <i>now</i> rejoice in my sufferings,&rdquo;
and try to turn them to others&#8217; good.</p>

<p>II. These thoughts naturally lead on to the statement
of the Apostle&#8217;s lowly and yet lofty conception
of his office&mdash;&ldquo;whereof (that is, of which <i>Church</i>) I
was made a minister, according to the dispensation
of God, which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil
the word of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first words of this clause are used at the close
of the preceding section in verse 23, but the &ldquo;whereof&rdquo;
there refers to the gospel, not as here to the
Church. He is the servant of both, and because he
is the servant of the Church he suffers, as he has
been saying. The representation of himself as
servant gives the reason for the conduct described
in the previous clause. Then the next words explain
what makes him the Church&#8217;s servant. He is
so in accordance with, or in pursuance of, the stewardship,
or office of administrator, of His household, to
which God has called him, &ldquo;to you-ward,&rdquo; that is to
say, with especial reference to the Gentiles. And
the final purpose of his being made a steward is &ldquo;to
fulfil the word of God&rdquo;; by which is not meant &ldquo;to
accomplish or bring to pass its predictions,&rdquo; but &ldquo;to
bring it to completion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;to give full development
to it,&rdquo; and that possibly in the sense of preaching it
fully, without reserve, and far and wide throughout
the whole world.</p>

<p>So lofty and yet so lowly was Paul&#8217;s thought of
his office. He was the Church&#8217;s servant, and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bound to suffer cheerfully for its sake. He was
so, because a high honour had been conferred on
him by God, nothing less than the stewardship of
His great household the Church, in which he had
to give to every man his portion, and to exercise
authority. He is the Church&#8217;s servant indeed, but
it is because he is the Lord&#8217;s steward. And the
purpose of his appointment goes far beyond the
interests of any single Church; for while his office
sends him especially to the Colossians, its scope is
as wide as the world.</p>

<p>One great lesson to be learned from these words
is that Stewardship means service; and we may
add that, in nine cases out of ten, service means
suffering. What Paul says, if we put it into more
familiar language, is just this: &ldquo;Because God has
given me something that I can impart to others, I
am their servant, and bound, not only by my duty
to Him, but by my duty to them, to labour that
they may receive the treasure.&rdquo; That is true for
us all. Every gift from the great Householder involves
the obligation to impart it. It makes us His
stewards and our brethren&#8217;s servants. We have
that we may give. The possessions are the Householder&#8217;s,
not ours, even after He has given them to
us. He gives us truths of various kinds in our
minds, the gospel in our hearts, influence from our
position, money in our pockets, not to lavish on
self, nor to hide and gloat over in secret, but that
we may transmit His gifts, and &ldquo;God&#8217;s grace
fructify through us to all.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is required of
stewards that a man be found faithful&rdquo;; and the
heaviest charge, &ldquo;that he had wasted his Lord&#8217;s
goods,&rdquo; lies against every one of us who does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
use all that he possesses, whether of material or
intellectual or spiritual wealth, for the common
advantage.</p>

<p>But that common obligation of stewardship presses
with special force on those who say that they are
Christ&#8217;s servants. If we are, we know something
of His love and have felt something of His power;
and there are hundreds of people around us, many of
whom we can influence, who know nothing of either.
That fact makes us their servants, not in the sense
of being under their control, or of taking orders
from them, but in the sense of gladly working for
them, and recognising our obligation to help them.
Our resources may be small. The Master of the
house may have entrusted us with little. Perhaps
we are like the boy with the five barley loaves and
two small fishes; but even if we had only a bit of
the bread and a tail of one of the fishes, we must
not eat our morsel alone. Give it those who have
none, and it will multiply as it is distributed, like
the barrel of meal, which did not fail because its
poor owner shared it with the still poorer prophet.
Give, and not only give, but &ldquo;pray them with much
entreaty to receive the gift&rdquo;; for men need to have
the true Bread pressed on them, and they will often
throw it back, or drop it over a wall, as soon as
your back is turned, as beggars do in our streets.
We have to win them by showing that we are their
servants, before they will take what we have to give.
Besides this, if stewardship is service, service is often
suffering; and he will not clear himself of his obligations
to his fellows, or of his responsibility to his
Master, who shrinks from seeking to make known the
love of Christ to his brethren, because he has often to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
&ldquo;go forth weeping&rdquo; whilst he bears the precious
seed.</p>

<p>III. So we come to the last thought here, which
is of the grand Mystery of which Paul is the Apostle
and Servant. Paul always catches fire when he
comes to think of the universal destination of the
gospel, and of the honour put upon him as the man
to whom the task was entrusted of transforming the
Church from a Jewish sect to a world-wide society.
That great thought now sweeps him away from his
more immediate object, and enriches us with a burst
which we could ill spare from the letter.</p>

<p>His task, he says, is to give its full development
to the word of God, to proclaim a certain mystery
long hid, but now revealed to those who are consecrated
to God. To these it has been God&#8217;s good
pleasure to show the wealth of glory which is contained
in this mystery, as exhibited among the
Gentile Christians, which mystery is nothing else
than the fact that Christ dwells in or among these
Gentiles, of whom the Colossians are part, and by
His dwelling in them gives them the confident expectation
of future glory.</p>

<p>The mystery then of which the Apostle speaks
so rapturously is the fact that the Gentiles were
fellow-heirs and partakers of Christ. &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo;
is a word borrowed from the ancient systems, in
which certain rites and doctrines were communicated
to the initiated. There are several allusions to
them in Paul&#8217;s writings, as for instance in the
passage in Philippians iv. 12, which the Revised
Version gives as &ldquo;I have learned the secret both to
be filled and to be hungry,&rdquo; and probably in the
immediate context here, where the characteristic word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; means &ldquo;initiated.&rdquo; Portentous theories
which have no warrant have been spun out of this
word. The Greek mysteries implied secrecy; the
rites were done in deep obscurity; the esoteric
doctrines were muttered in the ear. The Christian
mysteries are spoken on the housetop, nor does the
word imply anything as to the comprehensibility of
the doctrines or facts which are so called.</p>

<p>We talk about &ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; meaning thereby
truths that transcend human faculties; but the New
Testament &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; may be, and most frequently
is, a fact perfectly comprehensible when once spoken.
&ldquo;Behold I show you a mystery: We shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed.&rdquo; There is nothing
incomprehensible in that. We should never have
known it if we had not been told; but when told
it is quite level with our faculties. And as a matter
of fact, the word is most frequently used in connection
with the notion, not of concealment, but of
declaring. We find too that it occurs frequently
in this Epistle, and in the parallel letter to the
Ephesians, and in every instance but one refers as it
does here, to a fact which was perfectly plain and
comprehensible when once made known; namely,
the entrance of the Gentiles into the Church.</p>

<p>If that be the true meaning of the word, then &ldquo;a
steward of the mysteries&rdquo; will simply mean a man
who has truths, formerly unknown but now revealed,
in charge to make known to all who will hearken,
and neither the claims of a priesthood nor the demand
for the unquestioning submission of the intellect
have any foundation in this much abused term.</p>

<p>But turning from this, we may briefly consider
what was the substance of this grand mystery which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
thrilled Paul&#8217;s soul. It is the wonderful fact that
all barriers were broken down, and that Christ dwelt
in the hearts of these Colossians. He saw in that
the proof and the prophecy of the world-wide destination
of the gospel. No wonder that his heart
burned as he thought of the marvellous work which
God had wrought by him. For there is no greater
revolution in the history of the world than that
accomplished through him, the cutting loose of
Christianity from Judaism and widening the Church
to the width of the race. No wonder that he
was misunderstood and hated by Jewish Christians
all his days!</p>

<p>He thinks of these once heathens and now Christians
at Colossæ, far away in their lonely valley, and of
many another little community&mdash;in Judæa, Asia,
Greece, and Italy; and as he thinks of how a real
solid bond of brotherhood bound them together in
spite of their differences of race and culture, the
vision of the oneness of mankind in the Cross of
Christ shines out before him, as no man had ever
seen it till then, and he triumphs in the sorrows that
had helped to bring about the great result.</p>

<p>That dwelling of Christ among the Gentiles
reveals the exuberant abundance of glory. To him
the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; was all running over with riches, and
blazing with fresh radiance. To us it is familiar
and somewhat worn. The &ldquo;vision splendid,&rdquo; which
was manifestly a revelation of hitherto unknown
Divine treasures of mercy and lustrous light when it
first dawned on the Apostle&#8217;s sight, has &ldquo;faded&rdquo;
somewhat &ldquo;into the light of common day&rdquo; for us,
to whom the centuries since have shown so slow a
progress. But let us not lose more than we can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
help, either by our familiarity with the thought, or
by the discouragements arising from the chequered
history of its partial realization. Christianity is still
the only religion which has been able to make permanent
conquests. It is the only one that has
been able to disregard latitude and longitude, and
to address and guide condition of civilization and
modes of life quite unlike those of its origin. It is
the only one that sets itself the task of conquering
the world without the sword, and has kept true to
the design for centuries. It is the only one whose
claims to be world-wide in its adaptation and
destiny would not be laughed out of court by its
history. It is the only one which is to-day a
missionary religion. And so, notwithstanding the
long centuries of arrested growth and the wide tracts
of remaining darkness, the mystery which fired
Paul&#8217;s enthusiasm is still able to kindle ours, and
the wealth of glory that lies in it has not been impoverished
nor stricken with eclipse.</p>

<p>One last thought is here,&mdash;that the possession of
Christ is the pledge of future blessedness. &ldquo;Hope&rdquo;
here seems to be equivalent to &ldquo;the source&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ground&rdquo; of the hope. If we have the experience
of His dwelling in our hearts, we shall have, in that
very experience of His sweetness and of the intimacy
of His love, a marvellous quickener of our hope that
such sweetness and intimacy will continue for ever.
The closer we keep to Him, the clearer will be our
vision of future blessedness. If He is throned in
our hearts, we shall be able to look forward with a
hope, which is not less than certainty, to the perpetual
continuance of His hold of us and of our
blessedness in Him. Anything seems more credible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to a man who habitually has Christ abiding in him,
than that such a trifle as death should have power
to end such a union. To have Him is to have life.
To have Him will be heaven. To have Him is to
have a hope certain as memory and careless of
death or change.</p>

<p>That hope is offered to us all. If by our faith
in His great sacrifice we grasp the great truth of
&ldquo;Christ for us,&rdquo; our fears will be scattered, sin and
guilt taken away, death abolished, condemnation
ended, the future a hope and not a dread. If by
communion with Him through faith, love, and
obedience, we have &ldquo;Christ in us,&rdquo; our purity will
grow, and our experience will be such as plainly
to demand eternity to complete its incompleteness
and to bring its folded buds to flower and fruit. If
Christ be in us, His life guarantees ours, and we
cannot die whilst He lives. The world has come,
in the persons of its leading thinkers, to the position
of proclaiming that all is dark beyond and above.
&ldquo;Behold! we know not anything,&rdquo; is the dreary
&ldquo;end of the whole matter&rdquo;&mdash;infinitely sadder than
the old Ecclesiastes, which from &ldquo;vanity of vanities&rdquo;
climbed to &ldquo;fear God and keep His commandments,&rdquo;
as the sum of human thought and life.
&ldquo;I find no God; I know no future.&rdquo; Yes! Paul
long ago told us that if we were &ldquo;without Christ&rdquo;
we should &ldquo;have no hope, and be without God in
the world.&rdquo; And cultivated Europe is finding out
that to fling away Christ and to keep a faith in God
or in a future life is impossible.</p>

<p>But if we will take Him for our Saviour by
simple trust, He will give us His own presence in
our hearts, and infuse there a hope full of immortality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
If we live in close communion with Him,
we shall need no other assurance of an eternal life
beyond than that deep, calm blessedness springing
from the imperfect fellowship of earth which must
needs lead to and be lost in the everlasting and
completed union of heaven.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every
man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
whereunto I labour also, striving according to His working, which
worketh in me mightily,&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> i. 28, 29 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The false teachers at Colossæ had a great deal
to say about a higher wisdom reserved for the
initiated. They apparently treated the Apostolic
teaching as trivial rudiments, which might be good
for the vulgar crowd, but were known by the possessors
of this higher truth to be only a veil for it.
They had their initiated class, to whom their mysteries
were entrusted in whispers.</p>

<p>Such absurdities excited Paul&#8217;s special abhorrence.
His whole soul rejoiced in a gospel for all men.
He had broken with Judaism on the very ground
that it sought to enforce a ceremonial exclusiveness,
and demanded circumcision and ritual observances
along with faith. That was, in Paul&#8217;s estimate, to
destroy the gospel. These Eastern dreamers at
Colossæ were trying to enforce an intellectual exclusiveness
quite as much opposed to the gospel.
Paul fights with all his might against that error.
Its presence in the Church colours this context,
where he uses the very phrases of the false teachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in order to assert the great principles which he
opposes to their teaching. &ldquo;Mystery,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or
initiated, &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo;&mdash;these are the key-words of the
system which he is combating; and here he presses
them into the service of the principle that the gospel
is for all men, and the most recondite secrets of its
deepest truth the property of every single soul that
wills to receive them. Yes, he says in effect, we
have mysteries. We have our initiated. We have
wisdom. But we have no whispered teachings, confined
to a little coterie; we have no inner chamber
closed to the many. We are not muttering hierophants,
cautiously revealing a little to a few, and
fooling the rest with ceremonies and words. Our
whole business is to tell out as fully and loudly as
we can what we know of Christ, to tell to <i>every</i> man
<i>all</i> the wisdom that we have learned. We fling open
the inmost sanctuary, and invite all the crowd to enter.</p>

<p>This is the general scope of the words before us
which state the object and methods of the Apostle&#8217;s
work; partly in order to point the contrast with
those other teachers, and partly in order to prepare
the way, by this personal reference, for his subsequent
exhortations.</p>

<p>I. We have here the Apostle&#8217;s own statement of
what he conceived his life work to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom we proclaim.&rdquo; All three words are emphatic.
&ldquo;Whom,&rdquo; not what&mdash;a person, not a system;
we &ldquo;proclaim,&rdquo; not we argue or dissertate about.
&ldquo;We&rdquo; preach&mdash;the Apostle associates himself with
all his brethren, puts himself in line with them,
points to the unanimity of their testimony&mdash;&ldquo;whether
it were they or I, so we preach.&rdquo; We have all one
message, a common type of doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
So then&mdash;the Christian teacher&#8217;s theme is not to
be a theory or a system, but a living Person. One
peculiarity of Christianity is that you cannot take
its message, and put aside Christ, the speaker of the
message, as you may do with all men&#8217;s teachings.
Some people say: &ldquo;We take the great moral and
religious truths which Jesus declared. They are the
all-important parts of His work. We can disentangle
them from any further connection with Him.
It matters comparatively little who first spoke them.&rdquo;
But that will not do. His person is inextricably
intertwined with His teaching, for a very large part
of His teaching is exclusively concerned with, and
all of it centres in, Himself. He is not only true,
but He is the truth. His message is, not only what
He said with His lips about God and man, but
also what He said about Himself, and what He did
in His life, death, and resurrection. You may take
Buddha&#8217;s sayings, if you can make sure that they
are his, and find much that is beautiful and true in
them, whatever you may think of him; you may
appreciate the teaching of Confucius, though you
know nothing about him but that he said so and so;
but you cannot do thus with Jesus. Our Christianity
takes its whole colour from what we think of Him.
If we think of Him as less than this chapter has
been setting Him forth as being, we shall scarcely
feel that <i>He</i> should be the preacher&#8217;s theme; but if
He is to us what He was to this Apostle, the sole
Revealer of God, the Centre and Lord of creation,
the Fountain of life to all which lives, the Reconciler
of men with God by the blood of His cross, then
the one message which a man may be thankful to
spend his life in proclaiming will be, Behold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Lamb! Let who will preach abstractions, the true
Christian minister has to preach the person and the
office&mdash;Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p>To preach Christ is to set forth the person, the
facts of His life and death, and to accompany these
with that explanation which turns them from being
merely a biography into a gospel. So much of
&ldquo;theory&rdquo; must go with the &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; or they will
be no more a gospel than the story of another life
would be. The Apostle&#8217;s own statement of &ldquo;the
gospel which he preached&rdquo; distinctly lays down
what is needed&mdash;&ldquo;how that Jesus Christ died.&rdquo;
That is biography, and to say that and stop there
is not to preach Christ; but add, &ldquo;For our sins,
according to the Scriptures, and that He was
raised again the third day,&rdquo;&mdash;preach <i>that</i>, the fact
and its meaning and power, and you will preach
Christ.</p>

<p>Of course there is a narrower and a wider sense
of this expression. There is the initial teaching,
which brings to a soul, who has never seen it before,
the knowledge of a Saviour, whose Cross is the
propitiation for sin; and there is the fuller teaching,
which opens out the manifold bearings of that
message in every region of moral and religious
thought. I do not plead for any narrow construction
of the words. They have been sorely abused,
by being made the battle-cry for bitter bigotry and
a hard system of abstract theology, as unlike what
Paul means by &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; as any cobwebs of Gnostic
heresy could be. Legitimate outgrowths of the
Christian ministry have been checked in their name.
They have been used as a cramping iron, as a
shibboleth, as a stone to fling at honest and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at young preachers. They have been made a
pillow for laziness. So that the very sound of the
words suggests to some ears, because of their use in
some mouths, ignorant narrowness.</p>

<p>But for all that, they are a standard of duty for
all workers for God, which it is not difficult to
apply, if the will to do so be present, and they are
a touch-stone to try the spirits, whether they be of
God. A ministry of which the Christ who lived and
died for us is manifestly the centre to which all
converges and from which all is viewed, may sweep
a wide circumference, and include many themes.
The requirement bars out no province of thought
or experience, nor does it condemn the preacher to
a parrot-like repetition of elementary truths, or a
narrow round of commonplace. It does demand
that all themes shall lead up to Christ, and all
teaching point to Him; that He shall be ever
present in all the preacher&#8217;s words, a diffused
even when not a directly perceptible presence; and
that His name, like some deep tone on an organ,
shall be heard sounding on through all the ripple
and change of the higher notes. Preaching Christ
does not exclude any theme, but prescribes the
bearing and purpose of all; and the widest compass
and richest variety are not only possible but
obligatory for him who would in any worthy sense
take this for the motto of his ministry, &ldquo;I determined
not to know anything among you, save Jesus
Christ and Him crucified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But these words give us not only the theme but
something of the manner of the Apostle&#8217;s activity.
&ldquo;We <i>proclaim</i>.&rdquo; The word is emphatic in its form,
meaning <i>to tell out</i>, and representing the proclamation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as full, clear, earnest. &ldquo;We are no muttering
mystery-mongers. From full lungs and in a voice
to make people hear, we shout aloud our message.
We do not take a man into a corner, and whisper
secrets into his ear; we cry in the streets, and our
message is for &lsquo;every man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the word not only implies the plain, loud
earnestness of the speaker, but also that what he
speaks is a <i>message</i>, that he is not a speaker of his
own words or thoughts, but of what has been told
him to tell. His gospel is a good message, and a
messenger&#8217;s virtue is to say exactly what he has
been told, and to say it in such a way that the
people to whom he has to carry it cannot but hear
and understand it.</p>

<p>This connection of the Christian minister&#8217;s office
contrasts on the one hand with the priestly theory.
Paul had known in Judaism a religion of which the
altar was the centre, and the official function of the
&ldquo;minister&rdquo; was to sacrifice. But now he has come
to see that &ldquo;the one sacrifice for sins for ever&rdquo;
leaves no room for a sacrificing priest in that Church
of which the centre is the Cross. We sorely need
that lesson to be drilled into the minds of men to-day,
when such a strange resurrection of priestism
has taken place, and good, earnest men, whose
devotion cannot be questioned, are looking on
preaching as a very subordinate part of their work.
For three centuries there has not been so much need
as now to fight against the notion of a priesthood in
the Church, and to urge this as the true definition of
the minister&#8217;s office: &ldquo;we preach,&rdquo; not &ldquo;we sacrifice,&rdquo;
not &ldquo;we <i>do</i>&rdquo; anything; &ldquo;we preach,&rdquo; not &ldquo;we work
miracles at any altar, or impart grace by any rites,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but by manifestation of the truth discharge our
office and spread the blessings of Christ.</p>

<p>This conception contrasts on the other hand,
with the false teachers&#8217; style of speech, which finds
its parallel in much modern talk. Their business
was to argue and refine and speculate, to spin
inferences and cobwebby conclusions. They sat in
a lecturer&#8217;s chair; we stand in a preacher&#8217;s pulpit.
The Christian minister has not to deal in such
wares; he has a message to proclaim, and if he
allows the &ldquo;philosopher&rdquo; in him to overpower the
&ldquo;herald,&rdquo; and substitutes his thoughts about the
message, or his arguments in favour of the message,
for the message itself, he abdicates his highest
office and neglects his most important function.</p>

<p>We hear many demands to-day for a &ldquo;higher
type of preaching,&rdquo; which I would heartily echo, if
only it be <i>preaching</i>; that is, the proclamation in
loud and plain utterance of the great facts of Christ&#8217;s
work. But many who ask for this really want, not
preaching, but something quite different; and many,
as I think, mistaken Christian teachers are trying
to play up to the requirements of the age by turning
their sermons into dissertations, philosophical or
moral or æsthetic. We need to fall back on this
&ldquo;we preach,&rdquo; and to urge that the Christian minister
is neither priest nor lecturer, but a herald, whose
business is to tell out his message, and to take good
care that he tells it faithfully. If, instead of blowing
his trumpet and calling aloud his commission, he
were to deliver a discourse on acoustics and the
laws of the vibration of sonorous metal, or to prove
that he had a message, and to dilate on its evident
truth or on the beauty of its phrases, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
scarcely be doing his work. No more is the Christian
minister, unless he keeps clear before himself as
the guiding star of his work this conception of his
theme and his task&mdash;<i>Whom we preach</i>&mdash;and opposes
that to the demands of an age, one half of which
&ldquo;require a sign,&rdquo; and would again degrade him into
a priest, and the other calls for &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; and would
turn him into a professor.</p>

<p>II. We have here the varying methods by which
this one great end is pursued. &ldquo;Admonishing every
man and teaching every man in all wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are then two main methods&mdash;&ldquo;admonishing&rdquo;
and &ldquo;teaching.&rdquo; The former means &ldquo;admonishing
with blame,&rdquo; and points, as many commentators
remark, to that side of the Christian ministry
which corresponds to repentance, while the latter
points to that side which corresponds to faith. In
other words, the former rebukes and warns, has to
do with conduct and the moral side of Christian
truth; the latter has chiefly to do with doctrine,
and the intellectual side. In the one Christ is
proclaimed as the pattern of conduct, the &ldquo;new
commandment&rdquo;; in the other, as the creed of
creeds, the new and perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>The preaching of Christ then is to be unfolded
into all &ldquo;warning,&rdquo; or admonishing. The teaching of
morality and the admonishing of the evil and the
end of sin are essential parts of preaching Christ.
We claim for the pulpit the right and the duty of
applying the principles and pattern of Christ&#8217;s life
to all human conduct. It is difficult to do, and is
made more so by some of the necessary conditions
of our modern ministry, for the pulpit is not the
place for details; and yet moral teaching which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
confined to general principles is woefully like repeating
platitudes and firing blank cartridges. Everybody
admits the general principles, and thinks they
do not apply to his specific wrong action; and if
the preacher goes beyond these toothless generalities,
he is met with the cry of &ldquo;personalities.&rdquo; If a man
preaches a sermon in which he speaks plainly about
tricks of trade or follies of fashion, somebody is
sure to say, going down the chapel steps, &ldquo;Oh!
ministers know nothing of business,&rdquo; and somebody
else to add, &ldquo;It is a pity he was so personal,&rdquo; and
the chorus is completed by many other voices, &ldquo;He
should preach Christ, and leave secular things
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well! whether a sermon of that sort be preaching
Christ or not depends on the way in which it is
done. But sure I am that there is no &ldquo;preaching
Christ&rdquo; completely, which does not include plain
speaking about plain duties. Everything that a
man can either do rightly or wrongly belongs to the
sphere of morals, and everything within the sphere
of morals belongs to Christianity and to &ldquo;preaching
Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor is such preaching complete without plain
warning of the end of sin, as death here and hereafter.
This is difficult, for many people like to have
the smooth side of truth always put uppermost.
But the gospel has a rough side, and is by no
means a &ldquo;soothing syrup&rdquo; merely. There are no
rougher words about what wrongdoers come to than
some of Christ&#8217;s words; and he has only given half
his Master&#8217;s message who hides or softens down the
grim saying, &ldquo;The wages of sin is death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all this moral teaching must be closely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
connected with and built upon Christ. Christian
morality has Jesus for its perfect exemplar, His love
for its motive, and His grace for its power. Nothing
is more impotent than mere moral teaching. What
is the use of perpetually saying to people, Be good,
be good? You may keep on at that for ever, and
not a soul will listen, any more than the crowds
on our streets are drawn to church by the bell&#8217;s
monotonous call. But if, instead of a cold ideal of
duty, as beautiful and as dead as a marble statue,
we preach the Son of man, whose life is our law
incarnate; and instead of urging to purity by
motives which our own evil makes feeble, we re-echo
His heart-touching appeal, &ldquo;If ye love Me, keep My
commandments;&rdquo; and if, instead of mocking lame
men with exhortations to walk, we point those who
despairingly cry, &ldquo;Who shall deliver us from the
body of this death?&rdquo; to Him who breathes His
living spirit into us to set us free from sin and death,
then our preaching of morality will be &ldquo;preaching
the gospel&rdquo; and be &ldquo;preaching Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gospel is also to be unfolded into &ldquo;teaching.&rdquo;
In the facts of Christ&#8217;s life and death, as
we ponder them and grow up to understand them,
we get to see more and more the key to all things.
For thought, as for life, He is the alpha and omega,
the beginning and the ending. All that we can or
need know about God or man, about present duty or
future destiny, about life, death, and the beyond,&mdash;all
is in Jesus Christ, and to be drawn from Him
by patient thought and by abiding in Him. The
Christian minister&#8217;s business is to be ever learning
and ever teaching more and more of the &ldquo;manifold
wisdom&rdquo; of God. He has to draw for himself from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the deep, inexhaustible fountains; he has to bear
the water, which must be fresh drawn to be pleasant
or refreshing, to thirsty lips. He must seek to
present all sides of the truth, teaching <i>all</i> wisdom,
and so escaping from his own limited mannerisms.
How many ministers&#8217; Bibles are all dog-eared and
thumbed at certain texts, at which they almost open
of themselves, and are as clean in most of their
pages as on the day when they were bought!</p>

<p>The Christian ministry, then, in the Apostle&#8217;s view,
is distinctly educational in its design. Preachers
and hearers equally need to be reminded of this.
We preachers are poor scholars ourselves, and in
our work are tempted, like other people, to do most
frequently what we can do with least trouble.
Besides which, we many of us know, and all suspect,
that our congregations prefer to hear what they have
heard often before, and what gives them the least
trouble. We often hear the cry for &ldquo;simple preaching,&rdquo;
by which one school intends &ldquo;simple instruction
in plain, practical matters, avoiding mere dogma,&rdquo;
and another intends &ldquo;the simple gospel,&rdquo; by which
is meant the repetition over and over again of the
great truth, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo; God forbid that I
should say a word which might even seem to under-estimate
the need for that proclamation being made
in its simple form, as the staple of the Christian
ministry, to all who have not welcomed it into their
hearts, or to forget that, however dimly understood,
it will bring light and hope and new loves and
strengths into a soul! But the New Testament draws
a distinction between evangelists and teachers, and
common sense insists that Christian people need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
more than the reiteration of that message from him
whom they call their &ldquo;teacher.&rdquo; If he is a teacher,
he should teach; and he cannot do that, if the
people who listen to him suspect everything that
they do not know already, and are impatient of
anything that gives them the trouble of attending
and thinking in order to learn. I fear there is
much unreality in the name, and that nothing would
be more distasteful to many of our congregations
than the preacher&#8217;s attempt to make it truly
descriptive of his work. Sermons should not be
&ldquo;quiet resting places.&rdquo; Nor is it quite the ideal of
Christian teaching that busy men should come to
church or chapel on a Sunday, and not be fatigued
by being made to think, but perhaps to be able to
sleep for a minute or two and pick up the thread
when they wake, quite sure that they have missed
nothing of any consequence. We are meant to be
teachers, as well as evangelists, though we fulfil the
function so poorly; but our hearers often make that
task more difficult by ill-concealed impatience with
sermons which try to discharge it.</p>

<p>Observe too the emphatic repetition of &ldquo;every
man&rdquo; both in these two clauses and in the following.
It is Paul&#8217;s protest against the exclusiveness of the
heretics, who shut out the mob from their mysteries.
An intellectual aristocracy is the proudest and most
exclusive of all. A Church built upon intellectual
qualifications would be as hard and cruel a <i>coterie</i>
as could be imagined. So there is almost vehemence
and scorn in the persistent repetition in each clause
of the obnoxious word, as if he would thrust down
his antagonists&#8217; throats the truth that his gospel has
nothing to do with cliques and sections, but belongs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the world. To it philosopher and fool are
equally welcome. Its message is to all. Brushing
aside surface diversities, it goes straight to deep-lying
wants, which are the same in all men. Below
king&#8217;s robe and professor&#8217;s gown, and workman&#8217;s
jacket and prodigal&#8217;s rags, beats the same heart with
the same wants, wild longings, and weariness.
Christianity knows no hopeless classes. But its
highest wisdom can be spoken to the little child and
the barbarian, and it is ready to deal with the most
forlorn and foolish, knowing its own power to &ldquo;warn
every man and to teach every man in all wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. We have here the ultimate aim of these
diverse methods. &ldquo;That we may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found this same word &ldquo;present&rdquo; in verse 22.
The remarks made there will apply here. There
the Divine purpose of Christ&#8217;s great work, and here
Paul&#8217;s purpose in his, are expressed alike. God&#8217;s
aim is Paul&#8217;s aim too. The Apostle&#8217;s thoughts
travel on to the great coming day, when we shall all
be manifested at the judgment seat of Christ, and
preacher and hearer, Apostle and convert, shall be
gathered there. That solemn period will test the
teacher&#8217;s work, and should ever be in his view as he
works. There is a real and indissoluble connection
between the teacher and his hearers, so that in some
sense he is to blame if they do not stand perfect
then, and he in some sense has to present them
as in his work&mdash;the gold, silver, and precious
stones which he has built on the foundation. So
each preacher should work with that end clear
in view, as Paul did. He is always toiling in the
light of that great vision. One sees him, in all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
letters, looking away yonder to the horizon, where
he expects the breaking of its morning low down in
the eastern sky. Ah! how many formal pulpit and
how many a languid pew would be galvanised into
intense action if only their occupants once saw
burning in on them, in their decorous deadness, the
light of that great white throne! How differently
we should preach if we always felt &ldquo;the terror of
the Lord,&rdquo; and under its solemn influence sought to
&ldquo;persuade men!&rdquo; How differently we should hear
if we felt we must appear before the Judge, and
give account to Him of our profitings by His word!</p>

<p>And the purpose which the true minister of Christ
has in view is to &ldquo;present every man <i>perfect in
Christ Jesus</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; may be used here with
the technical signification of &ldquo;initiated,&rdquo; but it means
absolute moral completeness. Negatively, it implies
the entire removal of all defects; positively, the
complete possession of all that belongs to human
nature as God meant it to be. The Christian aim,
for which the preaching of Christ supplies ample
power, is to make the whole race possess, in fullest
development, the whole circle of possible human
excellences. There is to be no one-sided growth
but men are to grow like a tree in the open, which
has no barrier to hinder its symmetry, but rises and
spreads equally on all sides, with no branch broken
or twisted, no leaf worm-eaten or wind-torn, no fruit
blighted or fallen, no gap in the clouds of foliage,
no bend in the straight stem,&mdash;a green and growing
completeness. This absolute completeness is attainable
&ldquo;in Christ,&rdquo; by union with Him of that vital
sort brought about by faith, which will pour His
Spirit into our spirits. The preaching of Christ is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
therefore plainly the direct way to bring about this
perfecting. That is the Christian theory of the way
to make perfect men.</p>

<p>And this absolute perfection of character is, in
Paul&#8217;s belief, possible for every man, no matter what
his training or natural disposition may have been.
The gospel is confident that it can change the
Ethiopian&#8217;s skin, because it can change his heart,
and the leopard&#8217;s spots will be altered when it &ldquo;eats
straw like the ox.&rdquo; There are no hopeless classes,
in the glad, confident view of the man who has
learned Christ&#8217;s power.</p>

<p>What a vision of the future to animate work!
What an aim! What dignity, what consecration,
what enthusiasm it would give, making the trivial
great and the monotonous interesting, stirring up
those who share it to intense effort, overcoming low
temptations, and giving precision to the selection of
means and use of instruments! The pressure of a
great, steady purpose consolidates and strengthens
powers, which, without it, become flaccid and feeble.
We can make a piece of calico as stiff as a board by
putting it under an hydraulic press. Men with a
fixed purpose are terrible men. They crash through
conventionalities like a cannon ball. They, and they
only, can persuade and arouse and impress their own
enthusiasm on the inert mass. &ldquo;Behold, how great
a matter a little fire kindleth!&rdquo; No Christian minister
will work up to the limits of his power, nor do
much for Christ or man, unless his whole soul is
mastered by this high conception of the possibilities
of his office, and unless he is possessed with the
ambition to present every man &ldquo;perfect in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
IV. Note the struggle and the strength with
which the Apostle reaches toward this aim. &ldquo;Whereunto
I labour also, striving according to His working,
which worketh in me mightily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the object, theme, and method of the
Christian ministry, Paul can speak, as he does in the
previous verses, in the name of all his fellow
workers: &ldquo;<i>We</i> preach, admonishing and teaching,
that we may present.&rdquo; There was substantial unity
among them. But he adds a sentence about his
own toil and conflict in doing his work. He will
only speak for himself now. The others may say
what their experience has been. He has found that
he cannot do his work easily. Some people may be
able to get through it with little toil of body or
agony of mind, but for himself it has been laborious
work. He has not learned to &ldquo;take it easy.&rdquo; That
great purpose has been ever before him, and made
a slave of him. &ldquo;I labour <i>also</i>&rdquo;; I do not only
preach, but I <i>toil</i>&mdash;as the word literally implies&mdash;like
a man tugging at an oar, and putting all his
weight into each stroke. No great work for God
will be done without physical and mental strain and
effort. Perhaps there were people in Colossæ who
thought that a man who had nothing to do but to
preach had a very easy life, and so the Apostle had
to insist that most exhausting work is brain work
and heart work. Perhaps there were preachers and
teachers there who worked in a leisurely, dignified
fashion, and took great care always to stop a long
way on the safe side of weariness; and so he had
to insist that God&#8217;s work cannot be done at all in
that fashion, but has to be done &ldquo;with both hands,
earnestly.&rdquo; The &ldquo;immortal garland&rdquo; is to be run for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
&ldquo;not without dust and heat.&rdquo; The racer who takes
care to slack his speed whenever he is in danger of
breaking into a perspiration will not win the prize.
The Christian minister who is afraid of putting all
his strength into his work, up to the point of weariness,
will never do much good.</p>

<p>There must be not only toil, but conflict. He
labours, &ldquo;<i>striving</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, contending&mdash;with
hindrances, both without and within, which
sought to mar his work. There is the struggle with
one&#8217;s self, with the temptations to do high work
from low motives, or to neglect it, and to substitute
routine for inspiration and mechanism for fervour.
One&#8217;s own evil, one&#8217;s weaknesses and fears and
falsities, and laziness and torpor and faithlessness,
have all to be fought, besides the difficulties and
enemies without. In short, all good work is a
battle.</p>

<p>The hard strain and stress of this life of effort and
conflict made this man &ldquo;Paul the aged&rdquo; while he
was not old in years. Such soul&#8217;s agony and travail
is indispensable for all high service of Christ. How
can any true, noble Christian life be lived without
continuous effort and continual strife? Up to the
last particle of our power, it is our duty to work.
As for the sleepy, languid, self-indulgent service of
modern Christians, who seem to be chiefly anxious
not to overstrain themselves, and to manage to win
the race set before them without turning a hair, I
am afraid that a large deduction will have to be
made from it in the day that shall &ldquo;try every man&#8217;s
work, of what sort it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much for the struggle; now for the strength.
The toil and the conflict are to be carried on &ldquo;according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to His working, which worketh in me mightily.&rdquo;
The measure of our power then is Christ&#8217;s power
in us. He whose presence makes the struggle
necessary, by His presence strengthens us for it.
He will dwell in us and work in us, and even our
weakness will be lifted into joyful strength by Him.
We shall be mighty because that mighty Worker
is in our spirits. We have not only His presence
beside us as an ally, but His grace within us. We
may not only have the vision of our Captain
standing at our side as we front the foe&mdash;an unseen
presence to them, but inspiration and victory to us&mdash;but
we may have the consciousness of His power
welling up in our spirits and flowing, as immortal
strength, into our arms. It is much to know that
Christ fights for us; it is more to know that He
fights in us.</p>

<p>Let us take courage then for all work and conflict;
and remember that if we have not &ldquo;striven
according to the power&rdquo;&mdash;that is, if we have not
utilised <i>all</i> our Christ-given strength in His service&mdash;we
have not striven enough. There may be a
double defect in us. We may not have taken all
the power that he Has given, and we may not have
used all the power that we have taken. Alas, for us!
we have to confess both faults. How weak we have
been when Omnipotence waited to give Itself to us!
How little we have made our own of the grace that
flows so abundantly past us, catching such a small part
of the broad river in our hands, and spilling so
much even of that before it reached our lips! And
how little of the power given, whether natural or
spiritual, we have used for our Lord! How many
weapons have hung rusty and unused in the fight!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He has sowed much in our hearts, and reaped little.
Like some unkindly soils, we have &ldquo;drunk in the
rain which cometh oft upon it,&rdquo; and have &ldquo;<i>not</i>
brought forth herbs fit for Him by whom it is
dressed.&rdquo; Talents hid, the Master&#8217;s goods squandered,
power allowed to run to waste, languid service
and half-hearted conflict, we have all to acknowledge.
Let us go to Him and confess that, &ldquo;we have
most unthankful been,&rdquo; and are unprofitable servants
indeed, coming far short of duty. Let us yield our
spirits to His influence, that He may work in us
that which is pleasing in His sight, and may encircle
us with ever-growing completeness of beauty and
strength, until He &ldquo;present us faultless before the
presence of His glory with exceeding joy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="ColX" id="ColX"></a>X.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>PAUL&#8217;S STRIVING FOR THE COLOSSIANS.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the
flesh; that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in
love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that
they may know the mystery of God, even Christ, in Whom are all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii. 1&ndash;3 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We have seen that the closing portion of the
previous chapter is almost exclusively personal.
In this context the same strain is continued,
and two things are dwelt on: the Apostle&#8217;s agony
of anxiety for the Colossian Church, and the joy
with which, from his prison, he travelled in spirit
across mountain and sea, and saw them in their quiet
valley, cleaving to the Lord. The former of these
feelings is expressed in the words now before us;
the latter, in the following verses.</p>

<p>All this long outpouring of self-revelation is so
natural and characteristic of Paul that we need
scarcely look for any purpose in it, and yet we may
note with what consummate art he thereby prepares
the way for the warnings which follow. The
unveiling of his own throbbing heart was sure to
work on the affections of his readers and to incline
them to listen. His profound emotion in thinking
of the preciousness of his message would help to
make them feel how much was at stake, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
unfaltering faith would give firmness to their less
tenacious grasp of the truth which, as they saw,
he gripped with such force. Many truths may be
taught coolly, and some must be. But in religious
matters, arguments wrought in frost are powerless,
and earnestness approaching to passion is the all-conquering
force. A teacher who is afraid to show
his feelings, or who has no feelings to show, will
never gather many disciples.</p>

<p>So this revelation of the Apostle&#8217;s heart is relevant
to the great purposes of the whole letter&mdash;the
warning against error, and the exhortation to stedfastness.
In the verses which we are now considering,
we have the conflict which Paul was waging
set forth in three aspects: first, in itself; second, in
regard to the persons for whom it was waged; and,
finally and principally, in regard to the object or
purpose in view therein. The first and second of
these points may be dealt with briefly. The third
will require further consideration.</p>

<p>I. There is first the conflict, which he earnestly
desired that the Colossian Christians might know to
be &ldquo;great.&rdquo; The word rendered in the Authorised
Version &ldquo;conflict,&rdquo; belongs to the same root as that
which occurs in the last verse of the previous chapter,
and is there rendered &ldquo;striving.&rdquo; The Revised
Version rightly indicates this connection by its
translation, but fails to give the construction as
accurately as the older translation does. &ldquo;What
great strife I have&rdquo; would be nearer the Greek, and
more forcible than the somewhat feeble &ldquo;how
greatly I strive,&rdquo; which the Revisers have adopted.
The conflict referred to is, of course, that of the
arena, as so often in Paul&#8217;s writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
But how could he, in Rome, wage conflict on
behalf of the Church at Colossæ? No external
conflict can be meant. He could strike no blows
on their behalf. What he could do in that way, he
did, and he was now taking part in their battle by
this letter. If he could not fight by their side, he
could send them ammunition, as he does in this
great Epistle, which was, no doubt, to the eager
combatants for the truth at Colossæ, what it has
been ever since, a magazine and arsenal in all
their warfare. But the real struggle was in his own
heart. It meant anxiety, sympathy, an agony of
solicitude, a passion of intercession. What he says
of Epaphras in this very Epistle was true of himself.
He was &ldquo;always striving in prayer for them.&rdquo; And
by these wrestlings of spirit he took his place among
the combatants, though they were far away, and
though in outward seeming, his life was untouched
by any of the difficulties and dangers which
hemmed them in. In that lonely prison-cell, remote
from their conflict, and with burdens enough of his
own to carry, with his life in peril, his heart yet
turned to them and, like some soldier left behind to
guard the base while his comrades had gone forward
to the fight, his ears listened for the sound of battle,
and his thoughts were in the field. His prison cell
was like the focus of some reverberating gallery
in which every whisper spoken all round the circumference
was heard, and the heart that was held
captive there was set vibrating in all its chords by
every sound from any of the Churches.</p>

<p>Let us learn the lesson, that, for all Christian
people, sympathy in the battle for God, which is being
waged all over the world, is plain duty. For all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Christian teachers of every sort, an eager sympathy
in the difficulties and struggles of those whom they
would try to teach is indispensable. We can never
deal wisely with any mind until we have entered into
its peculiarities. We can never help a soul fighting
with errors and questionings until we have ourselves
felt the pinch of the problems, and have shown that
soul that we know what it is to grope and stumble.
No man is ever able to lift a burden from another&#8217;s
shoulders except on condition of bearing the burden
himself. If I stretch out my hand to some poor
brother struggling in &ldquo;the miry clay,&rdquo; he will not
grasp it, and my well-meant efforts will be vain,
unless he can see that I too have felt with him the
horror of great darkness, and desire him to share
with me the benedictions of the light.</p>

<p>Wheresoever our prison or our workshop may be,
howsoever Providence or circumstances&mdash;which is but
a heathenish word for the same thing&mdash;may separate
us from active participation in any battle for God,
we are bound to take an eager share in it by sympathy,
by interest, by such help as we can render,
and by that intercession which may sway the fortunes
of the field, though the uplifted hands grasp no
weapons, and the spot where we pray be far from
the fight. It is not only the men who bear the
brunt of the battle in the high places of the field
who are the combatants. In many a quiet home,
where their wives and mothers sit, with wistful faces
waiting for the news from the front, are an agony of
anxiety, and as true a share in the struggle as amidst
the battery smoke and the gleaming bayonets. It
was a law in Israel, &ldquo;As his part is that goeth down
to the battle, so shall his part be that abideth by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
stuff. They shall part alike.&rdquo; They were alike in
recompense, because they were rightly regarded as
alike in service. So all Christians who have in heart
and sympathy taken part in the great battle shall be
counted as combatants and crowned as victors, though
they themselves have struck no blows. &ldquo;He that
receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receive a prophet&#8217;s reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. We notice the persons for whom this conflict
was endured. They are the Christians of Colossæ,
and their neighbours of Laodicea, and &ldquo;as many
as have not seen my face in the flesh.&rdquo; It may be
a question whether the Colossians and Laodiceans
belong to those who have not seen his face in the flesh,
but the most natural view of the words is that the last clause
&ldquo;introduces the whole class to which the persons previously enumerated
belong,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and this conclusion is confirmed by the silence of the
Acts of the Apostles as to any visit of Paul&#8217;s to these
Churches, and by the language of the Epistle itself,
which, in several places, refers to his knowledge of
the Colossian Church as derived from hearing of
them, and never alludes to personal intercourse.
That being so, one can understand that its members
might easily think that he cared less for them than
he did for the more fortunate communities which he
had himself planted or watered, and might have suspected
that the difficulties of the Church at Ephesus,
for instance, lay nearer his heart than theirs in their
remote upland valley. No doubt, too, their feelings
to him were less warm than to Epaphras and to
other teachers whom they had heard. They had
never felt the magnetism of his personal presence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and were at a disadvantage in their struggle with
the errors which were beginning to lift their snaky
heads among them, from not having had the inspiration
and direction of his teaching.</p>

<p>It is beautiful to see how, here, Paul lays hold
of that very fact which seemed to put some film of
separation between them, in order to make it the
foundation of his especial keenness of interest in
them. Precisely because he had never looked them
in the eyes, they had a warmer place in his heart,
and his solicitude for them was more tender. He
was not so enslaved by sense that his love could
not travel beyond the limits of his eyesight. He
was the more anxious about them because they had
not the recollections of his teaching and of his
presence to fall back upon.</p>

<p>III. But the most important part of this section
is the Apostle&#8217;s statement of the great subject of his
solicitude, that which he anxiously longed that the
Colossians might attain. It is a prophecy, as well
as a desire. It is a statement of the deepest purpose
of his letter to them, and being so, it is likewise a
statement of the Divine desire concerning each of us,
and of the Divine design of the gospel. Here is set
forth what God would have all Christians to be, and,
in Jesus Christ, has given them ample means of
being.</p>

<p>(1) The first element in the Apostle&#8217;s desire for
them is &ldquo;that their hearts may be comforted.&rdquo; Of
course the Biblical use of the word &ldquo;heart&rdquo; is much
wider than the modern popular use of it. We mean
by it, when we use it in ordinary talk, the hypothetical
seat of the emotions, and chiefly, the organ
and throne of love; but Scripture means by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
word, the whole inward personality, including thought
and will as well as emotion. So we read of the
&ldquo;thoughts and intents of the heart,&rdquo; and the whole
inward nature is called &ldquo;the hidden man of the
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what does he desire for this inward man?
That it may be &ldquo;comforted.&rdquo; That word again has
a wider signification in Biblical, than in nineteenth
century English. It is much more than consolation
in trouble. The cloud that hung over the Colossian
Church was not about to break in sorrows which
they would need consolation to bear, but in doctrinal
and practical errors which they would need strength
to resist. They were called to fight rather than to
endure, and what they needed most was courageous
confidence. So Paul desires for them that their
hearts should be <i>encouraged</i> or strengthened, that
they might not quail before the enemy, but go into
the fight with buoyancy, and be of good cheer.</p>

<p>Is there any greater blessing in view both of the
conflict which Christianity has to wage to-day, and
of the difficulties and warfare of our own lives, than
that brave spirit, which plunges into the struggle
with the serene assurance that victory sits on our
helms and waits upon our swords, and knows that
anything is possible rather than defeat? That is the
condition of overcoming&mdash;even our faith. &ldquo;The sad
heart tires in a mile,&rdquo; but the strong hopeful heart
carries in its very strength the prophecy of triumph.</p>

<p>Such a disposition is not altogether a matter of
temperament, but may be cultivated, and though it
may come easier to some of us than to others, it
certainly ought to belong to all who have God to
trust to, and believe that the gospel is His truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
They may well be strong who have Divine power
ready to flood their hearts, who know that everything
works for their good, who can see, above the whirl
of time and change, one strong loving Hand which
moves the wheels. What have we to do with fear
for ourselves, or wherefore should our &ldquo;hearts tremble
for the ark of God,&rdquo; seeing that One fights by our
sides who will teach our hands to war and cover our
heads in the day of battle? &ldquo;Be of good courage,
and He shall strengthen thine heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(2) The way to secure such joyous confidence and
strength is taught us here, for we have next, <i>Union
in love</i>, as part of the means for obtaining it&mdash;&ldquo;They
being knit together in love.&rdquo; The persons,
not the hearts, are to be thus united. Love is the
true bond which unites men&mdash;the bond of perfectness,
as it is elsewhere called. That unity in love
would, of course, add to the strength of each. The
old fable teaches us that little fagots bound together
are strong, and the tighter the rope is pulled, the
stronger they are. A solitary heart is timid and
weak, but many weaknesses brought together make
a strength, as slimly built houses in a row hold each
other up, or dying embers raked closer burst into
flame. Loose grains of sand are light and moved
by a breath; compacted they are rock against which
the Atlantic beats in vain. So, a Church, of which
the members are bound together by that love which
is the only real bond of Church life, presents a front
to threatening evils through which they cannot break.
A real moral defence against even intellectual error
will be found in such a close compaction in mutual
Christian love. A community so interlocked will
throw off many evils, as a Roman legion with linked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
shields roofed itself over against missiles from the
wall of a besieged city, or the imbricated scales on
a fish keep it dry in the heart of the sea.</p>

<p>But we must go deeper than this in interpreting
these words. The love which is to knit Christian
men together is not merely love to one another, but
is common love to Jesus Christ. Such common love
to Him is the true bond of union, and the true
strengthener of men&#8217;s hearts.</p>

<p>(3) This compaction in love will lead to a wealth
of certitude in the possession of the truth.</p>

<p>Paul is so eagerly desirous for the Colossians&#8217;
union in love to each other and all to God, because
He knows that such union will materially contribute
to their assured and joyful possession of the truth.
It tends, he thinks, unto &ldquo;all riches of the full
assurance of understanding,&rdquo; by which he means
the wealth which consists in the entire, unwavering
certitude which takes possession of the understanding,
the confidence that it has the truth and
the life in Jesus Christ. Such a joyful stedfastness
of conviction that I have grasped the truth is opposed
to hesitating half belief. It is attainable, as this
context shows, by paths of moral discipline, and
amongst them, by seeking to realize our unity with
our brethren, and not proudly rejecting the &ldquo;common
faith&rdquo; because it is common. Possessing that
assurance, we shall be rich and heart-whole. Walking
amid certainties we shall walk in paths of peace,
and re-echo the triumphant assurance of the Apostle,
to whom love had given the key of knowledge:&mdash;&ldquo;we
know that we are of God, and we know that
the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding,
that we may know Him that is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
In all times of religious unsettlement, when an
active propaganda of denial is going on, Christian
men are tempted to lower their own tone, and to
say, &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; with somewhat less of certainty,
because so many are saying, &ldquo;It is not so.&rdquo; Little
Rhoda needs some courage to affirm constantly that
&ldquo;it was even so,&rdquo; when apostles and her masters
keep assuring her that she has only seen a vision.
In this day, many professing Christians falter in the
clear assured profession of their faith, and it does
not need a keen ear to catch an undertone of doubt
making their voices tremulous. Some even are so
afraid of being thought &ldquo;narrow,&rdquo; that they seek
for the reputation of liberality by talking as if there
were a film of doubt over even the truths which
used to be &ldquo;most surely believed.&rdquo; Much of the
so-called faith of this day is all honeycombed with
secret misgivings, which have in many instances no
other intellectual basis than the consciousness of
prevalent unbelief and a second-hand acquaintance
with its teachings. Few things are more needed
among us now than this full assurance and satisfaction
of the understanding with the truth as it is
in Jesus. Nothing is more wretched than the slow
paralysis creeping over faith, the fading of what had
been stars into darkness. A tragedy is being
wrought in many minds which have had to exchange
Christ&#8217;s &ldquo;Verily, verily,&rdquo; for a miserable
&ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; and can no longer say &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; but only,
&ldquo;I would fain believe,&rdquo; or at the best, &ldquo;I incline to
think still.&rdquo; On the other hand, the &ldquo;full assurance
of the understanding&rdquo; brings wealth. It breathes
peace over the soul, and gives endless riches in the
truths which through it are made living and real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
This wealth of conviction is attained by living in
the love of God. Of course, there is an intellectual
discipline which is also needed. But no intellectual
process will lead to an assured grasp of spiritual
truth, unless it be accompanied by love. As soon
may we lay hold of truth with our hands, as of God
in Christ with our understandings alone. This is the
constant teaching of Scripture&mdash;that, if we would
know God and have assurance of Him, we must love
Him. &ldquo;In order to love human things, it is
necessary to know them. In order to know Divine
things, it is necessary to love them.&rdquo; When we
are rooted and grounded in love, we shall be able
to know&mdash;for what we have most need to know and
what the gospel has mainly to teach us is the love,
and &ldquo;unless the eye with which we look is love, how
shall we know love?&rdquo; If we love, we shall possess
an experience which verifies the truth for us, will
give us an irrefragable demonstration which will
bring certitude to ourselves, however little it may
avail to convince others. Rich in the possession
of this confirmation of the gospel by the blessings
which have come to us from it, and which witness
of their source, as the stream that dots some barren
plain with a line of green along its course is revealed
thereby, we shall have the right to oppose to
many a doubt the full assurance born of love, and
while others are disputing whether there be any God,
or any living Christ, or any forgiveness of sins, or
any guiding providence, we shall know that they are,
and are ours, because we have felt the power and
wealth which they have brought into our lives.</p>

<p>(4) This unity of love will lead to full knowledge
of the mystery of God. Such seems to be the connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the next words, which may be literally read
&ldquo;unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God,&rdquo;
and may be best regarded as a co-ordinate clause
with the preceding, depending like it on &ldquo;being
knit together in love.&rdquo; So taken, there is set forth
a double issue of that compaction in love to God
and one another, namely, the calm assurance in the
grasp of truth already possessed, and the more
mature and deeper insight into the deep things of
God. The word for knowledge here is the same as
in i. 9, and here as there means a full knowledge.
The Colossians had known Christ at first, but the
Apostle&#8217;s desire is that they may come to a fuller
knowledge, for the object to be known is infinite,
and endless degrees in the perception and possession
of His power and grace are possible. In that
fuller knowledge they will not leave behind what
they knew at first, but will find in it deeper meaning,
a larger wisdom and a fuller truth.</p>

<p>Among the large number of readings of the following
words, that adopted by the Revised Version is
to be preferred, and the translation which it gives
is the most natural and is in accordance with the
previous thought in chapter i. 27, where also &ldquo;the
mystery&rdquo; is explained to be &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; A
slight variation in the conception is presented here.
The &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; is Christ, not &ldquo;in you,&rdquo; but &ldquo;in
Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.&rdquo; The great truth long hidden, now
revealed, is that the whole wealth of spiritual insight
(knowledge), and of reasoning on the truths thus
apprehended so as to gain an ordered system of
belief and a coherent law of conduct (wisdom), is
stored for us in Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Such being in brief the connection and outline
meaning of these great words, we may touch upon
the various principles embodied in them. We have
seen, in commenting upon a former part of the
Epistle, the force of the great thought that Christ in
His relations to us is the mystery of God, and need
not repeat what was then said. But we may pause
for a moment on the fact that the knowledge of
that mystery has its stages. The revelation of the
mystery is complete. No further stages are possible
in that. But while the revelation is, in Paul&#8217;s
estimate, finished, and the long concealed truth now
stands in full sunshine, our apprehension of it may
grow, and there is a mature knowledge possible.
Some poor ignorant soul catches through the gloom
a glimpse of God manifested in the flesh, and bearing
his sins. That soul will never outgrow that knowledge,
but as the years pass, life and reflection and
experience will help to explain and deepen it. God
so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son&mdash;there is nothing beyond that truth. Grasped
however imperfectly, it brings light and peace.
But as it is loved and lived by, it unfolds undreamed-of
depths, and flashes with growing brightness.
Suppose that a man could set out from the great
planet that moves on the outermost rim of our
system, and could travel slowly inwards towards the
central sun, how the disc would grow, and the light
and warmth increase with each million of miles that
he crossed, till what had seemed a point filled the
whole sky! Christian growth is into, not away
from Christ, a penetrating deeper into the centre,
and a drawing out into distinct consciousness as a
coherent system, all that was wrapped, as the leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in their brown sheath, in that first glimpse of Him
which saves the soul.</p>

<p>These stages are infinite, because in Him are all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. These four
words, <i>treasures</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, <i>knowledge</i>, <i>hidden</i>, are all
familiar on the lips of the latter Gnostics, and were
so, no doubt, in the mouths of the false teachers at
Colossæ. The Apostle would assert for his gospel
all which they falsely claimed for their dreams. As
in several other places of this Epistle, he avails
himself of his antagonists&#8217; special vocabulary, transferring
its terms, from the illusory phantoms which a
false knowledge adorned with them, to the truth
which he had to preach. He puts special emphasis
on the predicate &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; by throwing it to the end
of the sentence&mdash;a peculiarity which is reproduced
with advantage in the Revised Version.</p>

<p>All wisdom and knowledge are in Christ. He is
the Light of men, and all thought and truth of every
sort come from Him Who is the Eternal Word,
the Incarnate Wisdom. That Incarnate Word is the
perfect Revelation of God, and by His one completed
life and death has declared the whole name
of God to His brethren, of which all other media of
revelation have but uttered broken syllables. That
ascended Christ breathes wisdom and knowledge into
all who love Him, and still pursues, by giving us the
Spirit of wisdom, His great work of revealing God
to men, according to His own word, which at once
asserted the completeness of the revelation made by
His earthly life and promised the perpetual continuance
of the revelation from His heavenly seat:
&ldquo;I have declared Thy name unto My brethren, and
will declare it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
In Christ, as in a great storehouse, lie all the
riches of spiritual wisdom, the massive ingots of solid
gold which when coined into creeds and doctrines
are the wealth of the Church. All which we can
know concerning God and man, concerning sin and
righteousness and duty, concerning another life, is in
Him Who is the home and deep mine where truth is
stored.</p>

<p>In Christ these treasures are &ldquo;hidden,&rdquo; but not,
as the heretics&#8217; mysteries were hidden, in order that
they might be out of reach of the vulgar crowd.
This mystery is hidden indeed, but it is revealed.
It is hidden only from the eyes that will not see it.
It is hidden that seeking souls may have the joy
of seeking and the rest of finding. The very act of
revealing is a hiding, as our Lord has said in His
great thanksgiving because these things are (by one
and the same act) &ldquo;hid from the wise and prudent,
and revealed to babes.&rdquo; They are hid, as men store
provisions in the Arctic regions, in order that
the bears may not find them and the shipwrecked
sailors may.</p>

<p>Such thoughts have a special message for times
of agitation such as the Colossian Church was passing
through, and such as we have to face. We too are
surrounded by eager confident voices, proclaiming
profounder truths and a deeper wisdom than the
gospel gives us. In joyful antagonism to these,
Christian men have to hold fast by the confidence
that all Divine wisdom is laid up in their Lord.
We need not go to others to learn new truth. The
new problems of each generation to the end of time
will find their answers in Christ, and new issues of
that old message which we have heard from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
beginning will continually be discerned. Let us not
wonder if the lessons which the earlier ages of the
Church drew from that infinite storehouse fail at
many points to meet the eager questionings of to-day.
Nor let us suppose that the stars are quenched
because the old books of astronomy are in some
respects out of date. We need not cast aside the
truths that we learned at our mother&#8217;s knees. The
central fact of the universe and the perfect encyclopædia
of all moral and spiritual truth is Christ, the
Incarnate Word, the Lamb slain, the ascended King.
If we keep true to Him and strive to widen our
minds to the breadth of that great message, it will
grow as we gaze, even as the nightly heavens expand
to the eye which stedfastly looks into them, and
reveal violet abysses sown with sparkling points,
each of which is a sun. &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we
go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ordinary type of Christian life is contented
with a superficial acquaintance with Christ. Many
understand no more of Him and of His gospel than
they did when first they learned to love Him. So
completely has the very idea of a progressive knowledge
of Jesus Christ faded from the horizon of the
average Christian that &ldquo;edification,&rdquo; which ought to
mean the progressive building up of the character
course by course, in new knowledge and grace, has
come to mean little more than the sense of comfort
derived from the reiteration of old and familiar words
which fall on the ear with a pleasant murmur.
There is sadly too little first-hand and growing
knowledge of their Lord, among Christian people,
too little belief that fresh treasures may be found
hidden in that field which, to each soul and each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
new generation struggling with its own special forms
of the burdens and problems that press upon
humanity, would be cheaply bought by selling all,
but may be won at the easier rate of earnest desire
to possess them, and faithful adherence to Him in
whom they are stored for the world. The condition
of growth for the branch is abiding in the vine. If
our hearts are knit together with Christ&#8217;s heart in
that love which is the parent of communion, both as
delighted contemplation and as glad obedience, then
we shall daily dig deeper into the mine of wealth
which is hid in Him that it may be found, and draw
forth an unfailing supply of things new and old.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>CONCILIATORY AND HORTATORY TRANSITION TO
POLEMICS.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of
speech. For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your
faith in Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
rooted and builded up in Him, and stablished in your faith, even as
ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii. 4&ndash;7 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>Nothing needs more delicacy of hand and
gentleness of heart than the administration of
warning or reproof, especially when directed against
errors of religious opinion. It is sure to do harm
unless the person reproved is made to feel that it
comes from true kindly interest in him, and does full
justice to his honesty. Warning so easily passes
into scolding, and sounds to the warned so like it
even when the speaker does not mean it so, that
there is special need to modulate the voice very
carefully.</p>

<p>So in this context, the Apostle has said much
about his deep interest in the Colossian Church,
and has dwelt on the passionate earnestness of his
solicitude for them, his conflict of intercession and
sympathy, and the large sweep of his desires for their
good. But he does not feel that he can venture to
begin his warnings till he has said something more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
so as to conciliate them still further, and to remove
from their minds other thoughts unfavourable to the
sympathetic reception of his words. One can fancy
some Colossians saying, &ldquo;What need is there for all
this anxiety? Why should Paul be in such a taking
about us? He is exaggerating our danger, and doing
scant justice to our Christian character.&rdquo; Nothing
stops the ear to the voice of warning more surely
than a feeling that it is pitched in too solemn a key,
and fails to recognise the good.</p>

<p>So before he goes further, he gathers up his
motives in giving the following admonitions, and
gives his estimate of the condition of the Colossians,
in the two first of the verses now under consideration.
All that he has been saying has been said not so
much because he thinks that they have gone wrong,
but because he knows that there are heretical teachers
at work, who may lead them astray with plausible
lessons. He is not combating errors which have
already swept away the faith of the Colossian
Christians, but putting them on their guard against
such as threaten them. He is not trying to pump
the water out of a water-logged vessel, but to stop a
little leak which is in danger of gaping wider. And,
in his solicitude, he has much confidence and is
encouraged to speak because, absent from them as
he is, he has a vivid assurance, which gladdens him,
of the solidity and firmness of their faith.</p>

<p>So with this distinct definition of the precise
danger which he feared, and this soothing assurance
of his glad confidence in their stedfast order, the
Apostle at last opens his batteries. The 6th and
7th verses are the first shot fired, the beginning of
the monitions so long and carefully prepared for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
They contain a general exhortation, which may be
taken as the keynote for the polemical portion of
the Epistle, which occupies the rest of the chapter.</p>

<p>I. We have then first, the purpose of the Apostle&#8217;s
previous self-revelation. &ldquo;This I say&rdquo;&mdash;this namely
which is contained in the preceding verses, the expression
of his solicitude, and perhaps even more
emphatically, the declaration of Christ as the revealed
secret of God, the inexhaustible storehouse of all
wisdom and knowledge. The purpose of the Apostle,
then, in his foregoing words has been to guard the
Colossians against the danger to which they were
exposed, of being deceived and led astray by &ldquo;persuasiveness
of speech.&rdquo; That expression is not
necessarily used in a bad sense, but here it evidently
has a tinge of censure, and implies some doubt
both of the honesty of the speakers and of the truthfulness
of their words. Here we have an important
piece of evidence as to the then condition of the
Colossian Church. There were false teachers busy
amongst them who belonged in some sense to the
Christian community. But probably these were not
Colossians, but wandering emissaries of a Judaizing
Gnosticism, while certainly the great mass of the
Church was untouched by their speculations. They
were in danger of getting bewildered, and being
<i>deceived</i>, that is to say, of being induced to accept
certain teaching because of its speciousness, without
seeing all its bearings, or even knowing its real
meaning. So error ever creeps into the Church.
Men are caught by something fascinating in some
popular teaching, and follow it without knowing
where it will lead them. By slow degrees its
tendencies are disclosed, and at last the followers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the heresiarch wake to find that everything which
they once believed and prized has dropped from
their creed.</p>

<p>We may learn here, too, the true safeguard
against specious errors. Paul thinks that he can
best fortify these simple-minded disciples against all
harmful teaching by exalting his Master and urging
the inexhaustible significance of His person and
message. To learn the full meaning and preciousness
of Christ is to be armed against error. The
positive truth concerning Him, by preoccupying
mind and heart, guards beforehand against the most
specious teachings. If you fill the coffer with gold,
nobody will want, and there will be no room for,
pinchbeck. A living grasp of Christ will keep us
from being swept away by the current of prevailing
popular opinion, which is always much more likely
to be wrong than right, and is sure to be exaggerated
and one-sided at the best. A personal
consciousness of His power and sweetness will give
an instinctive repugnance to teaching that would
lower His dignity and debase His work. If He be
the centre and anchorage of all our thoughts, we shall
not be tempted to go elsewhere in search of the
&ldquo;treasures of wisdom and knowledge&rdquo; which &ldquo;are
hid in Him.&rdquo; He who has found the one pearl of
great price, needs no more to go seeking goodly
pearls, but only day by day more completely to lose
self, and give up all else, that he may win more and
more of Christ his All. If we keep our hearts and
minds in communion with our Lord, and have experience
of His preciousness, that will preserve us
from many a snare, will give us a wisdom beyond
much logic, will solve for us many of the questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
most hotly debated to-day, and will show us that
many more are unimportant and uninteresting to us.
And even if we should be led to wrong conclusions
on some matters, &ldquo;if we drink any deadly thing, it
shall not hurt us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. We see here the joy which blended with the
anxiety of the solitary prisoner, and encouraged him
to warn the Colossians against impending dangers
to their faith.</p>

<p>We need not follow the grammatical commentators
in their discussion of how Paul comes to
invert the natural order here, and to say &ldquo;joying
and beholding,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;beholding and rejoicing&rdquo;
as we should expect. No one doubts that
what he saw in spirit was the cause of his joy.
The old man in his prison, loaded with many cares,
compelled to be inactive in the cause which was
more to him than life, is yet full of spirit and
buoyancy. His prison-letters all partake of that
&ldquo;rejoicing in the Lord,&rdquo; which is the keynote of
one of them. Old age and apparent failure, and
the exhaustion of long labours, and the disappointments
and sorrows which almost always gather like
evening clouds round a life as it sinks in the west
had not power to quench his fiery energy or to blunt
his keen interest in all the Churches. His cell was
like the centre of a telephonic system. Voices
spoke from all sides. Every Church was connected
with it, and messages were perpetually being
brought. Think of him sitting there, eagerly
listening, and thrilling with sympathy at each word,
so self-oblivious was he, so swallowed up were all
personal ends in the care for the Churches, and in
the swift, deep fellow-feeling with them? Love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
interest quickened his insight, and though he was
far away, he had them so vividly before him that
he was as if a spectator. The joy which he had in
the thought of them made him dwell on the thought&mdash;so
the apparently inverted order of the words
may be the natural one and he may have looked all
the more fixedly because it gladdened him to look.</p>

<p>What did he see? &ldquo;Your order.&rdquo; That is
unquestionably a military metaphor, drawn probably
from his experiences of the Prætorians, while in
captivity. He had plenty of opportunities of studying
both the equipment of the single legionary, who,
in the 6th chapter of Ephesians, sat for his portrait
to the prisoner to whom he was chained, and also
the perfection of discipline in the whole which made
the legion so formidable. It was not a multitude
but a unit, &ldquo;moving altogether if it move at all,&rdquo; as
if animated by one will. Paul rejoices to know that
the Colossian Church was thus welded into a solid
unity.</p>

<p>Further, he beholds &ldquo;the stedfastness of your
faith in Christ.&rdquo; This may be a continuation of the
military metaphor, and may mean &ldquo;the solid front,
the close phalanx&rdquo; which your faith presents. But
whether we suppose the figure to be carried on or
dropped, we must, I think, recognise that this second
point refers rather to the inward condition than to
the outward discipline of the Colossians.</p>

<p>Here then is set forth a lofty ideal of the Church,
in two respects. First there is outwardly, an
ordered disciplined array; and secondly, there is a
stedfast faith.</p>

<p>As to the first, Paul was no martinet, anxious
about the pedantry of the parade ground, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
knew the need of organization and drill. Any body
of men united in order to carry out a specific purpose
have to be organized. That means a place for every
man, and every man in his place. It means co-operation
to one common end, and therefore division of
function and subordination. Order does not merely
mean obedience to authority. There may be equal
&ldquo;order&rdquo; under widely different forms of polity. The
legionaries were drawn up in close ranks, the light-armed
skirmishers more loosely. In the one case
the phalanx was more and the individual less; in
the other there was more play given to the single
man, and less importance to corporate action; but
the difference between them was not that of order
and disorder, but that of two systems, each organized
but on somewhat different principles and for different
purposes. A loosely linked chain is as truly a chain
as a rigid one. The main requirement for such
&ldquo;order&rdquo; as gladdened the Apostle is conjoint action
to one end, with variety of office, and unity of spirit.</p>

<p>Some Churches give more weight to the principle
of authority; others to that of individuality. They
may criticise each other&#8217;s polity, but the former has
no right to reproach the latter as being necessarily
defective in &ldquo;order.&rdquo; Some Churches are all drill
and their favourite idea of discipline is, Obey them
that have the rule over you. The Churches of looser
organization, on the other hand, are no doubt in
danger of making too little of organization. But
both need that all their members should be more
penetrated by the sense of unity, and should fill each
his place in the work of the body. It was far easier
to secure the true order&mdash;a place and a task for
every man and every man in his place and at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
task&mdash;in the small homogeneous communities of
apostolic times than it is now, when men of such
different social position, education, and ways of thinking
are found in the same Christian community.
The proportion of idlers in all Churches is a scandal
and a weakness. However highly organized and
officered a Church may be, no joy would fill an
apostle&#8217;s heart in beholding it, if the mass of its
members had no share in its activities. Every
society of professing Christians should be like a man
of war&#8217;s crew, each of whom knows the exact inch
where he has to stand when the whistle sounds, and
the precise thing he has to do in the gun drill.</p>

<p>But the perfection of discipline is not enough.
That may stiffen into routine if there be not something
deeper. We want life even more than order.
The description of the soldiers who set David on the
throne should describe Christ&#8217;s army&mdash;&ldquo;men that
could keep rank, they were not of double heart.&rdquo;
They had discipline and had learned to accommodate
their stride to the length of their comrades&#8217; step;
but they had whole-hearted enthusiasm, which was
better. Both are needed. If there be not courage
and devotion there is nothing worth disciplining.
The Church that has the most complete order and
not also stedfastness of faith will be like the German
armies, all pipeclay and drill, which ran like hares
before the ragged shoeless levies whom the first
French Revolution flung across the border with a
fierce enthusiasm blazing in their hearts. So the
Apostle beholds with joy the stedfastness of the
Colossians&#8217; faith toward Christ.</p>

<p>If the rendering &ldquo;stedfastness&rdquo; be adopted as in
the Rev. Ver., the phrase will be equivalent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
&ldquo;firmness which characterizes or belongs to your
faith.&rdquo; But some of the best commentators deny
that this meaning of the word is ever found, and
propose &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; (that which is made stedfast).
The meaning then will either be &ldquo;the firm foundation
(for your lives) which consists of your faith,&rdquo; or,
more probably, &ldquo;the firm foundation which your
faith has.&rdquo; He rejoices, seeing that their faith
towards Jesus Christ has a basis unshaken by assaults.</p>

<p>Such a rock foundation, and consequent stedfastness,
must faith have, if it is to be worthy of the
name and to manifest its true power. A tremulous
faith may, thank God! be a true faith, but the very
idea of faith implies solid assurance and fixed confidence.
Our faith should be able to resist pressure
and to keep its ground against assaults and gainsaying.
It should not be like a child&#8217;s card castle,
that the light breath of a scornful laugh will throw
down, but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;a tower of strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stands foursquare to all the winds that blow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We should seek to make it so, nor let the fluctuations
of our own hearts cause it to fluctuate. We
should try so to control the ebb and flow of religious
emotion that it may always be near high water with
our faith, a tideless but not stagnant sea. We should
oppose a settled conviction and unalterable confidence
to the noisy voices which would draw us away.</p>

<p>And that we may do so we must keep up a true
and close communion with Jesus Christ. The faith
which is ever going out &ldquo;towards&rdquo; Him, as the sunflower
turns sunwards, will ever draw from Him such
blessed gifts that doubt or distrust will be impossible.
If we keep near our Lord and wait expectant on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Him, He will increase our faith and make our
&ldquo;hearts fixed, trusting in the Lord.&rdquo; So a greater
than Paul may speak even to us, as He walks in the
midst of the golden candlesticks, words which from
<i>His</i> lips will be praise indeed: &ldquo;Though I am
absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness
of your faith in Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. We have here, the exhortation which comprehends
all duty, and covers the whole ground of
Christian belief and practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore&rdquo;&mdash;the following exhortation is based
upon the warning and commendation of the preceding
verses. There is first a wide general injunction.
&ldquo;As ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
walk in Him,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> let your active life be in accord
with what you learned and obtained when you first
became Christians. Then this exhortation is defined
or broken up into four particulars in the following
clauses, which explain in detail how it is to be kept.</p>

<p>The general exhortation is to a true Christian
walk. The main force lies upon the &ldquo;as.&rdquo; The
command is to order all life in accordance with the
early lessons and acquisitions. The phrase &ldquo;ye
received Christ Jesus the Lord&rdquo; presents several
points requiring notice. It is obviously parallel
with &ldquo;as ye were taught&rdquo; in the next verse; so that
it was from their first teachers, and probably from
Epaphras (i. 7) that they had &ldquo;received Christ.&rdquo; So
then what we receive, when, from human lips, we
hear the gospel and accept it, is not merely the
word about the Saviour, but the Saviour Himself.
This expression of our text is no mere loose or
rhetorical mode of speech, but a literal and blessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
truth. Christ is the sum of all Christian teaching
and, where the message of His love is welcomed,
He Himself comes in spiritual and real presence, and
dwells in the spirit.</p>

<p>The solemnity of the full name of our Saviour in
this connection is most significant. Paul reminds
the Colossians, in view of the teaching which
degraded the person and curtailed the work of
Christ, that they had received the man Jesus, the
promised Christ, the universal Lord. As if he had
said, Remember whom you received in your conversion&mdash;<i>Christ</i>,
the Messiah, anointed, that is, fitted
by the unmeasured possession of the Divine Spirit
to fulfil all prophecy and to be the world&#8217;s deliverer.
Remember <i>Jesus</i>, the man, our brother;&mdash;therefore
listen to no misty speculations nor look to whispered
mysteries nor to angel hierarchies for knowledge of
God or for help in conflict. Our gospel is not
theory spun out of men&#8217;s brains, but is, first and
foremost, the history of a brother&#8217;s life and death.
You received <i>Jesus</i>, so you are delivered from the
tyranny of these unsubstantial and portentous
systems, and relegated to the facts of a human life
for your knowledge of God. You received Jesus
Christ as <i>Lord</i>. He was proclaimed as Lord of men,
angels, and the universe, Lord and Creator of the
spiritual and material worlds, Lord of history and
providence. Therefore you need not give heed to
those teachers who would fill the gulf between men
and God with a crowd of powers and rulers. You
have all that your mind or heart or will can need in
the human Divine Jesus, who is the Christ and the
Lord for you and all men. You have received Him
in the all-sufficiency of His revealed nature and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
offices. You have Him for your very own. Hold
fast that which you have, and let no man take this
your crown and treasure. The same exhortation
has emphatic application to the conflicts of to-day.
The Church has had Jesus set forth as Christ and
Lord. His manhood, the historical reality of His
Incarnation with all its blessed issues, His Messiahship
as the fulfiller of prophecy and symbol, designated
and fitted by the fulness of the Spirit, to be
man&#8217;s deliverer, His rule and authority over all
creatures and events have been taught, and the
tumults of present unsettlement make it hard and
needful to keep true to that threefold belief, and to
let nothing rob us of any of the elements of the full
gospel which lies in the august name, Christ Jesus
the Lord.</p>

<p>To that gospel, to that Lord, the walk, the active
life, is to be conformed, and the manner thereof is
more fully explained in the following clauses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rooted and built up in Him.&rdquo; Here again we
have the profound &ldquo;in Him,&rdquo; which appears so frequently
in this and in the companion Epistle to the
Ephesians, and which must be allowed its proper
force, as expressing a most real indwelling of the
believer in Christ, if the depth of the meaning is to
be sounded.</p>

<p>Paul drives his fiery chariot through rhetorical proprieties,
and never shrinks from &ldquo;mixed metaphors&rdquo;
if they more vigorously express his thought. Here
we have three incongruous ones close on each other&#8217;s
heels. The Christian is to <i>walk</i>, to be <i>rooted</i> like
a tree, to be <i>built up</i> like a house. What does the
incongruity matter to Paul as the stream of thought
and feeling hurries him along?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
The tenses of the verbs, too, are studiously and
significantly varied. Fully rendered they would be
&ldquo;having been rooted and being builded up.&rdquo; The
one is a past act done once for all, the effects of
which are permanent; the other is a continuous
resulting process which is going on now. The
Christian has been rooted in Jesus Christ at the
beginning of his Christian course. His faith has
brought him into living contact with the Saviour,
who has become as the fruitful soil into which the
believer sends his roots, and both feeds and anchors
there. The familiar image of the first Psalm may
have been in the writer&#8217;s mind, and naturally recurs
to ours. If we draw nourishment and stability from
Christ, round whom the roots of our being twine and
cling, we shall flourish and grow and bear fruit. No
man can do without some person beyond himself on
whom to repose, nor can any of us find in ourselves
or on earth the sufficient soil for our growth. We
are like seedlings dropped on some great rock, which
send their rootlets down the hard stone and are
stunted till they reach the rich leaf-mould at its
base. We blindly feel through all the barrenness
of the world for something into which our roots may
plunge that we may be nourished and firm. In
Christ we may be &ldquo;like a tree planted by the river
of water;&rdquo; out of Him we are &ldquo;as the chaff,&rdquo;
rootless, lifeless, profitless, and swept at last by the
wind from the threshing floor. The choice is before
every man&mdash;either to be rooted in Christ by faith,
or to be rootless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being built up in Him.&rdquo; The gradual continuous
building up of the structure of a Christian
character is doubly expressed in this word by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
present tense which points to a process, and by
the prefixed preposition represented by &ldquo;up,&rdquo; which
points to the successive laying of course of masonry
upon course. We are the architects of our own
characters. If our lives are based on Jesus Christ
as their foundation, and every deed is in vital
connection with Him, as at once its motive, its
pattern, its power, its aim, and its reward, then we
shall build holy and fair lives, which will be temples.
Men do not merely grow as a leaf which &ldquo;grows
green and broad, and takes no care.&rdquo; The other
metaphor of a building needs to be taken into
account, to complete the former. Effort, patient
continuous labour must be put forth. More than
&ldquo;forty and six years is this temple in building.&rdquo;
A stone at a time is fitted into its place, and so
after much toil and many years, as in the case of
some mediæval cathedral unfinished for centuries, the
topstone is brought forth at last. This choice, too,
is before all men&mdash;to build on Christ and so to
build for eternity, or on sand and so to be crushed
below the ruins of their fallen houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stablished in your faith, even as ye were taught.&rdquo;
This is apparently simply a more definite way of
putting substantially the same thoughts as in the
former clauses. Possibly the meaning is &ldquo;stablished
by faith,&rdquo; the Colossians&#8217; faith being the instrument
of their establishment. But the Revised Version is
probably right in its rendering, &ldquo;stablished in,&rdquo; or
as to, &ldquo;your faith.&rdquo; Their faith, as Paul had just
been saying, was stedfast, but it needed yet increased
firmness. And this exhortation, as it were, translates
the previous ones into more homely language,
that if any man stumbled at the mysticism of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thoughts there, he might grasp the plain practicalness
here. If we are established and confirmed in
our faith, we shall be rooted and built up in Jesus,
for it is faith which joins us to Him, and its increase
measures our growth in and into Him.</p>

<p>There then is a very plain practical issue of these
deep thoughts of union with Jesus. A progressive
increase of our faith is the condition of all Christian
progress. The faith which is already the firmest,
and by its firmness may gladden an Apostle, is still
capable of and needs strengthening. Its range can
be enlarged, its tenacity increased, its power over
heart and life reinforced. The eye of faith is never
so keen but that it may become more longsighted; its
grasp never so close but that it may be tightened;
its realisation never so solid but that it may be
more substantial; its authority never so great but
that it may be made more absolute. This continual
strengthening of faith is the most essential form of a
Christian&#8217;s effort at self-improvement. Strengthen
faith and you strengthen all graces; for it measures
our reception of Divine help.</p>

<p>And the furthest development which faith can
attain should ever be sedulously kept in harmony
with the initial teaching&mdash;&ldquo;even as ye were taught.&rdquo;
Progress does not consist in dropping the early
truths of Jesus Christ the Lord for newer wisdom
and more speculative religion, but in discovering
ever deeper lessons and larger powers in these
rudiments which are likewise the last and highest
lessons which men can learn.</p>

<p>Further, as the daily effort of the believing soul
ought to be to strengthen the quality of his faith, so
it should be to increase its amount&mdash;&ldquo;abounding in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
it with thanksgiving.&rdquo; Or if we adopt the reading
of the Revised Version, we shall omit the &ldquo;in it,&rdquo;
and find here only an exhortation to thanksgiving.
That is, in any case, the main idea of the clause,
which adds to the former the thought that thanksgiving
is an inseparable accompaniment of vigorous
Christian life. It is to be called forth, of course,
mainly by the great gift of Christ, in whom we are
rooted and builded, and, in Paul&#8217;s judgment it is the
very spring of Christian progress.</p>

<p>That constant temper of gratitude implies a
habitual presence to the mind, of God&#8217;s great mercy
in His unspeakable gift, a continual glow of heart
as we gaze, a continual appropriation of that gift for
our very own, and a continual outflow of our heart&#8217;s
love to the Incarnate and Immortal Love. Such
thankfulness will bind us to glad obedience, and will
give swiftness to the foot and eagerness to the will,
to run in the way of God&#8217;s commandments. It is
like genial sunshine, all flowers breathe perfume and
fruits ripen under its influence. It is the fire which
kindles the sacrifice of life and makes it go up in
fragrant incense-clouds, acceptable to God. The
highest nobleness of which man is capable is reached
when, moved by the mercies of God, we yield ourselves
living sacrifices, thank-offerings to Him Who
yielded Himself the sin-offering for us. The life
which is all influenced by thanksgiving will be pure,
strong, happy, in its continual counting of its gifts,
and in its thoughts of the Giver, and not least happy
and beautiful in its glad surrender of itself to Him
who has given Himself for and to it. The noblest
offering that we can bring, the only recompense
which Christ asks, is that our hearts and our lives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
should say, We thank thee, O Lord. &ldquo;By Him,
therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually,&rdquo; and the continual thanksgiving will
ensure continuous growth in our Christian character,
and a constant increase in the strength and depth of
our faith.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through
his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ: for in Him dwelleth all
the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him ye are made full, Who is
the head of all principality and power.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii. 8&ndash;10 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We come now to the first plain reference to the
errors which were threatening the peace of the
Colossian community. Here Paul crosses swords
with the foe. This is the point to which all his
previous words have been steadily converging.
The immediately preceding context contained the
positive exhortation to continue in the Christ Whom
they had received, having been rooted in Him as the
tree in a fertile place &ldquo;by the rivers of water,&rdquo; and
being continually builded up in Him, with ever-growing
completeness of holy character. The same
exhortation in substance is contained in the verses
which we have now to consider, with the difference
that it is here presented negatively, as warning and
dehortation, with distinct statement of the danger
which would uproot the tree and throw down the
building, and drag the Colossians away from union
with Christ.</p>

<p>In these words the Bane and Antidote are both
before us. Let us consider each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I. The Poison against which Paul warns the
Colossians is plainly described in our first verse, the
terms of which may require a brief comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take heed lest there shall be.&rdquo; The construction
implies that it is a real and not a hypothetical danger
which he sees threatening. He is not crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;
before there is need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps the tone of the warning
would be better conveyed if we read the more
familiar &ldquo;somebody&rdquo;; as if he had said&mdash;&ldquo;I name
no names&mdash;it is not the persons but the principles
that I fight against&mdash;but you know whom I mean
well enough. Let him be anonymous, you understand
who it is.&rdquo; Perhaps there was even a single
&ldquo;somebody&rdquo; who was the centre of the mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That maketh spoil of you.&rdquo; Such is the full
meaning of the word&mdash;and not &ldquo;injure&rdquo; or &ldquo;rob,&rdquo;
which the translation in the Authorized Version
suggests to an English reader. Paul sees the
converts in Colossæ taken prisoners and led away
with a cord round their necks, like the long strings
of captives on the Assyrian monuments. He had
spoken in the previous chapter (ver. 13) of the
merciful conqueror who had &ldquo;translated&rdquo; them
from the realm of darkness into a kingdom of light,
and now he fears lest a robber horde, making a
raid upon the peaceful colonists in their happy new
homes, may sweep them away again into bondage.</p>

<p>The instrument which the man-stealer uses, or
perhaps we may say, the cord, whose fatal noose will
be tightened round them, if they do not take care,
is &ldquo;philosophy and vain deceit.&rdquo; If Paul had been
writing in English, he would have put &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;
in inverted commas, to show that he was quoting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the heretical teachers&#8217; own name for their system,
if system it may be called, which was really a chaos.
For the true love of wisdom, for any honest, humble
attempt to seek after her as hid treasure, neither
Paul nor Paul&#8217;s Master have anything but praise and
sympathy and help. Where he met real, however
imperfect, searchers after truth, he strove to find
points of contact between them and his message,
and to present the gospel as the answer to their
questionings, the declaration of that which they
were groping to find. The thing spoken of here has
no resemblance but in name to what the Greeks in
their better days first called philosophy, and nothing
but that mere verbal coincidence warrants the representation&mdash;often
made both by narrow-minded
Christians, and by unbelieving thinkers&mdash;that Christianity
takes up a position of antagonism or suspicion
to it.</p>

<p>The form of the expression in the original shows
clearly that &ldquo;vain deceit,&rdquo; or more literally &ldquo;empty
deceit,&rdquo; describes the &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; which Paul is
bidding them beware of. They are not two things,
but one. It is like a blown bladder, full of wind,
and nothing else. In its lofty pretensions, and if
we take its own account of itself, it is a love of and
search after wisdom; but if we look at it more closely,
it is a swollen nothing, empty and a fraud. This is
what he is condemning. The genuine thing he has
nothing to say about here.</p>

<p>He goes on to describe more closely this impostor,
masquerading in the philosopher&#8217;s cloak. It
is &ldquo;after the traditions of men.&rdquo; We have seen in
a former chapter what a strange heterogeneous conglomerate
of Jewish ceremonial and Oriental dreams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the false teachers in Colossæ were preaching. Probably
both these elements are included here. It is
significant that the very expression, &ldquo;the traditions
of men,&rdquo; is a word of Christ&#8217;s, applied to the
Pharisees, whom He charges with &ldquo;leaving the
commandment of God, and holding fast the tradition
of men&rdquo; (Mark vii. 8). The portentous undergrowth
of such &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; which, like the riotous fertility
of creepers in a tropical forest, smother and kill the
trees round which they twine, is preserved for our
wonder and warning in the Talmud, where for thousands
and thousands of pages, we get nothing but
Rabbi So and So said this, but Rabbi So and So
said that; until we feel stifled, and long for one
Divine Word to still all the babble.</p>

<p>The Oriental element in the heresy, on the other
hand, prided itself on a hidden teaching which was
too sacred to be entrusted to books, and was passed
from lip to lip in some close conclave of muttering
teachers and listening adepts. The fact that all this,
be it Jewish, be it Oriental teaching, had no higher
source than men&#8217;s imaginings and refinings, seems to
Paul the condemnation of the whole system. His
theory is that in Jesus Christ, every Christian man
has the full truth concerning God and man, in their
mutual relations,&mdash;the authoritative Divine declaration
of all that can be known, the perfect exemplar
of all that ought to be done, the sun-clear illumination
and proof of all that dare be hoped. What an absurd
descent, then, from the highest of our prerogatives,
to &ldquo;turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven,&rdquo;
in order to listen to poor human voices, speaking
men&#8217;s thoughts!</p>

<p>The lesson is as needful to-day as ever. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
special forms of men&#8217;s traditions in question here
have long since fallen silent, and trouble no man
any more. But the tendency to give heed to human
teachers and to suffer them to come between us and
Christ is deep in us all. There is at one extreme
the man who believes in no revelation from God,
and, smiling at us Christians who accept Christ&#8217;s
words as final and Himself as the Incarnate truth,
often pays to his chosen human teacher a deference
as absolute as that which he regards as superstition,
when we render it to our Lord. At the other
extremity are the Christians who will not let Christ
and the Scripture speak to the soul, unless the
Church be present at the interview, like a jailer, with
a bunch of man-made creeds jingling at its belt.
But it is not only at the two ends of the line, but
all along its length, that men are listening to
&ldquo;traditions&rdquo; of men and neglecting &ldquo;the commandment
of God.&rdquo; We have all the same tendency in
us. Every man carries a rationalist and a traditionalist
under his skin. Every Church in Christendom,
whether it has a formal creed or no, is
ruled as to its belief and practice, to a sad extent,
by the &ldquo;traditions of the elders.&rdquo; The &ldquo;freest&rdquo; of
the Nonconformist Churches, untrammelled by any
formal confession, may be bound with as tight
fetters, and be as much dominated by men&#8217;s opinions,
as if it had the straitest of creeds. The mass of
our religious beliefs and practices has ever to be
verified, corrected and remodelled, by harking back
from creeds, written or unwritten, to the one Teacher,
the endless significance of Whose person and work is
but expressed in fragments by the purest and widest
thoughts even of those who have lived nearest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Him, and seen most of His beauty. Let us get
away from men, from the Babel of opinions and the
strife of tongues, that we may &ldquo;hear the words of
His mouth!&rdquo; Let us take heed of the empty fraud
which lays the absurd snare for our feet, that we can
learn to know God by any means but by listening
to His own speech in His Eternal Word, lest it lead
us away captive out of the Kingdom of the Light!
Let us go up to the pure spring on the mountain
top, and not try to slake our thirst at the muddy
pools at its base! &ldquo;Ye are Christ&#8217;s, be not the slave
of men.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another mark of this empty pretence of wisdom
which threatens to captivate the Colossians is, that
it is &ldquo;after the rudiments of the world.&rdquo; The word
rendered &ldquo;rudiments&rdquo; means the letters of the alphabet,
and hence comes naturally to acquire the
meaning of &ldquo;elements,&rdquo; or &ldquo;first principles,&rdquo; just as
we speak of the A B C of a science. The application
of such a designation to the false teaching, is,
like the appropriation of the term &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; to the
gospel, an instance of turning the tables and giving
back the teachers their own words. They boasted
of mysterious doctrines reserved for the initiated, of
which the plain truths that Paul preached were but
the elements, and they looked down contemptuously
on his message as &ldquo;milk for babes.&rdquo; Paul retorts on
them, asserting that the true mystery, the profound
truth long hidden and revealed, is the word which
he preached, and that the poverty-stricken elements,
fit only for infants, are in that swelling inanity which
called itself wisdom and was not. Not only does
he brand it as &ldquo;rudiments,&rdquo; but as &ldquo;rudiments of
the <i>world</i>,&rdquo; which is worse&mdash;that is to say, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
belonging to the sphere of the outward and material,
and not to the higher region of the spiritual, where
Christian thought ought to dwell. So two weaknesses
are charged against the system: it is the
mere alphabet of truth, and therefore unfit for grown
men. It moves, for all its lofty pretensions, in the
region of the visible and mundane things and is
therefore unfit for spiritual men. What features of
the system are referred to in this phrase? Its use
in the Epistle to the Galatians (iv. 3), as a synonyme
for the whole system of ritual observances and
ceremonial precepts of Judaism, and the present
context, which passes on immediately to speak of
circumcision, point to a similar meaning here, though
we may include also the ceremonial and ritual of the
Gentile religions, in so far as they contributed to the
outward forms which the Colossian heresy sought to
impose on the Church. This then is Paul&#8217;s opinion
about a system which laid stress on ceremonial and
busied itself with forms. He regards it as a deliberate
retrogression to an earlier stage. A religion of
rites had come first, and was needed for the spiritual
infancy of the race&mdash;but in Christ we ought to
have outgrown the alphabet of revelation, and, being
men, to have put away childish things. He regards
it further as a pitiable descent into a lower sphere,
a fall from the spiritual realm to the material, and
therefore unbecoming for those who have been enfranchised
from dependence upon outward helps and
symbols, and taught the spirituality and inwardness
of Christian worship.</p>

<p>We need the lesson in this day no less than did
these Christians in the little community in that
remote valley of Phrygia. The forms which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
urged on them are long since antiquated, but the
tendency to turn Christianity into a religion of ceremonial
is running with an unusually powerful current
to-day. We are all more interested in art, and think
we know more about it than our fathers did. The
eye and the ear are more educated than they used
to be, and a society as &ldquo;æsthetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;musical&rdquo;
as much cultured English society is becoming, will
like an ornate ritual. So, apart altogether from
doctrinal grounds, much in the conditions of to-day
works towards ritual religion. Nonconformist services
are less plain; some go from their ranks because
they dislike the &ldquo;bald&rdquo; worship in the chapel, and
prefer the more elaborate forms of the Anglican
Church, which in its turn is for the same reason
left by others who find their tastes gratified by
the complete thing, as it is to be enjoyed full blown
in the Roman Catholic communion. We may freely
admit that the Puritan reaction was possibly too
severe, and that a little more colour and form might
with advantage have been retained. But enlisting
the senses as the allies of the spirit in worship is
risky work. They are very apt to fight for their
own hand when they once begin, and the history of
all symbolic and ceremonial worship shows that the
experiment is much more likely to end in sensualising
religion than in spiritualising sense. The theory that
such aids make a ladder by which the soul may
ascend to God is perilously apt to be confuted by
experience, which finds that the soul is quite as
likely to go down the ladder as up it. The gratification
of taste, and the excitation of æsthetic
sensibility, which are the results of such aids to
worship, are not worship, however they may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
mistaken as such. All ceremonial is in danger of
becoming opaque instead of transparent as it was
meant to be, and of detaining mind and eye instead
of letting them pass on and up to God. Stained
glass is lovely, and white windows are &ldquo;barnlike,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;starved,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bare&rdquo;; but perhaps, if the
object is to get light and to see the sun, these
solemn purples and glowing yellows are rather in
the way. I for my part believe that of the two
extremes, a Quaker&#8217;s meeting is nearer the ideal of
Christian worship than High Mass, and so far as
my feeble voice can reach, I would urge, as eminently
a lesson for the day, Paul&#8217;s great principle here, that
a Christianity making much of forms and ceremonies
is a distinct retrogression and descent. You are
men in Christ, do not go back to the picture book
A B C of symbol and ceremony, which was fit for
babes. You have been brought in to the inner
sanctuary of worship in spirit; do not decline to
the beggarly elements of outward form.</p>

<p>Paul sums up his indictment in one damning
clause, the result of the two preceding. If the
heresy have no higher source than men&#8217;s traditions,
and no more solid contents than ceremonial observances,
it cannot be &ldquo;after Christ.&rdquo; He is
neither its origin, nor its substance, nor its rule and
standard. There is a fundamental discord between
every such system, however it may call itself Christian,
and Christ. The opposition may be concealed by
its teachers. They and their victims may not be
aware of it. They may not themselves be conscious
that by adopting it they have slipped off the
foundation; but they have done so, and though
in their own hearts they be loyal to Him, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
brought an incurable discord into their creeds which
will weaken their lives, if it do not do worse. Paul
cared very little for the dreams of these teachers,
except in so far as they carried them and others
away from his Master. The Colossians might
have as many ceremonies as they liked, and welcome;
but when these interfered with the sole
reliance to be placed on Christ&#8217;s work, then they
must have no quarter. It is not merely because
the teaching was &ldquo;after the traditions of men, after
the rudiments of the world,&rdquo; but because being so,
it was &ldquo;not after Christ,&rdquo; that Paul will have none
of it. He that touches his Master touches the
apple of his eye, and shades of opinion, and things
indifferent in practice, and otherwise unimportant
forms of worship, have to be fought to the death if
they obscure one corner of the perfect and solitary
work of the One Lord, who is at once the source,
the substance, and the standard of all Christian
teaching.</p>

<p>II. The Antidote.&mdash;&ldquo;For in Him dwelleth all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him ye are
made full, who is the head of all principality and
power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words may be a reason for the warning&mdash;&ldquo;Take
heed, <i>for</i>&rdquo;; or they may be a reason for the
implied exclusion of any teaching which is not after
Christ. The statement of its characteristics carries
in itself its condemnation. Anything &ldquo;not after
Christ&rdquo; is <i>ipso facto</i> wrong, and to be avoided&mdash;&ldquo;for,&rdquo;
etc. &ldquo;In Him&rdquo; is placed with emphasis at the beginning,
and implies &ldquo;and nowhere else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwelleth,&rdquo;
that is, has its permanent abode; where the tense
is to be noticed also, as pointing to the ascended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Christ. &ldquo;All the fulness of the Godhead,&rdquo; that is,
the whole unbounded powers and attributes of Deity,
where is to be noted the use of the abstract term
<i>Godhead</i>, instead of the more usual <i>God</i>, in order to
express with the utmost force the thought of the
indwelling in Christ of the whole essence and nature
of God. &ldquo;Bodily,&rdquo; that points to the Incarnation,
and so is an advance upon the passage in the former
chapter (ver. 19), which speaks of &ldquo;the fulness&rdquo;
dwelling in the Eternal Word, whereas this speaks
of the Eternal Word in whom the fulness dwelt becoming
flesh. So we are pointed to the glorified
corporeal humanity of Jesus Christ in His exaltation
as the abode, now and for ever, of all the fulness of the
Divine nature, which is thereby brought very near
to us. This grand truth seems to Paul to shiver to
pieces all the dreams of these teachers about angel
mediators, and to brand as folly every attempt to
learn truth and God anywhere else but in Him.</p>

<p>If He be the one sole temple of Deity in whom
all Divine glories are stored, why go anywhere else
in order to <i>see</i> or to <i>possess</i> God? It is folly; for
not only are all these glories stored in Him, but
they are so stored on purpose to be reached by us.
Therefore the Apostle goes on, &ldquo;and in Him ye are
made full;&rdquo; which sets forth two things as true in
the inward life of all Christians, namely, their living
incorporation in and union with Christ, and their
consequent participation in His fulness. Every one
of us may enter into that most real and close union
with Jesus Christ by the power of continuous faith
in Him. So may we be grafted into the Vine, and
builded into the Rock. If thus we keep our hearts
in contact with His heart and let Him lay His lip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
on our lips, He will breathe into us the breath of
His own life, and we shall live because He lives, and
in our measure, as He lives. All the fulness of God
is in Him, that from Him it may pass into us. We
might start back from such bold words if we did not
remember that the same apostle who here tells us
that that fulness dwells in Jesus, crowns his wonderful
prayer for the Ephesian Christians with that
daring petition, &ldquo;that ye may be filled with all the
fulness of God.&rdquo; The treasure was lodged in the
earthen vessel of Christ&#8217;s manhood that it might be
within our reach. He brings the fiery blessing of a
Divine life from Heaven to earth enclosed in the
feeble reed of His manhood, that it may kindle
kindred fire in many a heart. Freely the water of
life flows into all cisterns from the ever fresh stream,
into which the infinite depth of that unfathomable
sea of good pours itself. Every kind of spiritual
blessing is given therein. That stream, like a river
of molten lava, holds many precious things in its
flaming current, and will cool into many shapes
and deposit many rare and rich gifts. According
to our need it will vary itself, being to each
what the moment most requires,&mdash;wisdom, or
strength, or beauty, or courage, or patience. Out of
it will come whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report, as Rabbinical legends
tell us that the manna tasted to each man like the
food for which he wished most.</p>

<p>This process of receiving of all the Divine fulness
is a continuous one. We can but be approximating
to the possession of the infinite treasure which is
ours in Christ; and since the treasure is infinite, and
we can indefinitely grow in capacity of receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
God, there must be an eternal continuance of the
filling and an eternal increase of the measure of
what fills us. Our natures are elastic, and in love
and knowledge, as well as in purity and capacity for
blessedness, there are no bounds to be set to their
possible expansion. They will be widened by bliss
into a greater capacity for bliss. The indwelling
Christ will &ldquo;enlarge the place of His habitation,&rdquo;
and as the walls stretch and the roofs soar, He will
fill the greater house with the light of His presence
and the fragrance of His name. The condition of
this continuous reception of the abundant gift of a
Divine life is abiding in Jesus. It is &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; that
we are &ldquo;being filled full&rdquo;&mdash;and it is only so long
as we continue in Him that we continue full. We
cannot bear away our supplies, as one might a full
bucket from a well, and keep it full. All the grace
will trickle out and disappear unless we live in
constant union with our Lord, whose Spirit passes
into our deadness only so long as we are joined
to Him.</p>

<p>From all such thoughts Paul would have us draw
the conclusion&mdash;how foolish, then, it must be to go
to any other source for the supply of our needs!
Christ is &ldquo;the head of all principality and power,&rdquo;
he adds, with a reference to the doctrine of angel
mediators, which evidently played a great part in
the heretical teaching. If He is sovereign head of
all dignity and power on earth and heaven, why go
to the ministers, when we have access to the King;
or have recourse to erring human teachers, when we
have the Eternal Word to enlighten us; or flee to
creatures to replenish our emptiness, when we may
draw from the depths of God in Christ? Why should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
we go on a weary search after goodly pearls when the
richest of all is by us, if we will have it? Do we seek
to know God? Let us behold Christ, and let men talk
as they list. Do we crave a stay for our spirit, guidance
and impulse for our lives? Let us cleave to
Christ, and we shall be no more lonely and bewildered.
Do we need a quieting balm to be laid on conscience,
and the sense of guilt to be lifted from our hearts?
Let us lay our hands on Christ, the one sacrifice,
and leave all other altars and priests and ceremonies.
Do we look longingly for some light on the future?
Let us stedfastly gaze on Christ as He rises to
heaven bearing a human body into the glory of God.</p>

<p>Though all the earth were covered with helpers
and lovers of my soul, &ldquo;as the sand by the sea
shore innumerable,&rdquo; and all the heavens were sown
with faces of angels who cared for me and succoured
me, thick as the stars in the milky way&mdash;all could
not do for me what I need. Yea, though all these
were gathered into one mighty and loving creature,
even he were no sufficient stay for one soul of man.
We want more than creature help. We need the
whole fulness of the Godhead to draw from. It is
all there in Christ, for each of us. Whosoever will,
let him draw freely. Why should we leave the
fountain of living waters to hew out for ourselves,
with infinite pains, broken cisterns that can hold no
water? All we need is in Christ. Let us lift our
eyes from the low earth and all creatures, and behold
&ldquo;no man any more,&rdquo; as Lord and Helper, &ldquo;save
Jesus only,&rdquo; &ldquo;that we may be filled with all the
fulness of God.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE TRUE CIRCUMCISION.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made
with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision
of Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, wherein ye
were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who
raised Him from the dead. And you, being dead through your trespasses
and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, <i>I say</i>, did he quicken
together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii.
11&ndash;13 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>There are two opposite tendencies ever at
work in human nature to corrupt religion.
One is of the intellect; the other of the senses.
The one is the temptation of the cultured few; the
other, that of the vulgar many. The one turns religion
into theological speculation; the other, into a
theatrical spectacle. But, opposite as these tendencies
usually are, they were united in that strange
chaos of erroneous opinion and practice which Paul
had to front at Colossæ. From right and from left
he was assailed, and his batteries had to face both
ways. Here he is mainly engaged with the error
which insisted on imposing circumcision on these
Gentile converts.</p>

<p>I. To this teaching of the necessity of circumcision,
he first opposes the position that all Christian
men, by virtue of their union with Christ, have received
the true circumcision, of which the outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
rite was a shadow and a prophecy, and that therefore
the rite is antiquated and obsolete.</p>

<p>His language is emphatic and remarkable. It
points to a definite past time&mdash;no doubt the time
when they became Christians&mdash;when, because they
were in Christ, a change passed on them which is
fitly paralleled with circumcision. This Christian
circumcision is described in three particulars: as
&ldquo;not made with hands;&rdquo; as consisting in &ldquo;putting
off the body of the flesh;&rdquo; and as being &ldquo;of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is &ldquo;not made with hands,&rdquo; that is, it is not a
rite but a reality, not transacted in flesh but in spirit.
It is not the removal of ceremonial impurity, but
the cleansing of the heart. This idea of ethical
circumcision, of which the bodily rite is the type,
is common in the Old Testament, as, for instance,
&ldquo;The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart ...
to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart&rdquo;
(Deut. xxx. 6). This is the true Christian circumcision.</p>

<p>It consists in the &ldquo;putting off the body of the
flesh&rdquo;&mdash;for &ldquo;the sins of&rdquo; is an interpolation. Of
course a man does not shuffle off this mortal coil
when he becomes a Christian, so that we have to
look for some other meaning of the strong words.
They are very strong, for the word &ldquo;putting off&rdquo; is
intensified so as to express a complete stripping off
from oneself, as of clothes which are laid aside, and
is evidently intended to contrast the partial outward
circumcision as the removal of a small part of the
body, with the entire removal effected by union with
Christ. If that removal of &ldquo;the body of the flesh&rdquo;
is &ldquo;not made with hands,&rdquo; then it can only be in the
sphere of the spiritual life, that is to say, it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
consist in a change in the relation of the two constituents
of a man&#8217;s being, and that of such a kind
that, for the future, the Christian shall not live after
the flesh, though he live in the flesh. &ldquo;Ye are not
in the flesh, but in the Spirit,&rdquo; says Paul, and again
he uses an expression as strong as, if not stronger
than that of our text, when he speaks of &ldquo;the body&rdquo;
as &ldquo;being destroyed,&rdquo; and explains himself by
adding &ldquo;that henceforth we should not serve sin.&rdquo;
It is not the body considered simply as material and
fleshly that we put off, but the body considered as
the seat of corrupt and sinful affections and passions.
A new principle of life comes into men&#8217;s hearts
which delivers them from the dominion of these, and
makes it possible that they should live in the flesh,
not &ldquo;according to the lusts of the flesh, but according
to the will of God.&rdquo; True, the text regards this
divesting as complete, whereas, as all Christian men
know only too sadly, it is very partial, and realised
only by slow degrees. The ideal is represented
here,&mdash;what we receive &ldquo;in Him,&rdquo; rather than what
we actually possess and incorporate into our experience.
On the Divine side the change is complete.
Christ gives complete emancipation from the dominion
of sense, and if we are not in reality completely
emancipated, it is because we have not taken
the things that are freely given to us, and are not
completely &ldquo;<i>in</i> Him.&rdquo; So far as we are, we have
put off &ldquo;the flesh.&rdquo; The change has passed on us if
we are Christians. We have to work it out day by
day. The foe may keep up a guerilla warfare after
he is substantially defeated, but his entire subjugation
is certain if we keep hold of the strength of Christ.</p>

<p>Finally, this circumcision is described as &ldquo;of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Christ,&rdquo; by which is not meant that He submitted to
it, but that He instituted it.</p>

<p>Such being the force of this statement, what is
its bearing on the Apostle&#8217;s purpose? He desires
to destroy the teaching that the rite of circumcision
was binding on the Christian converts, and he does so
by asserting that the gospel has brought the reality,
of which the rite was but a picture and a prophecy.
The underlying principle is that when we have the
thing signified by any Jewish rites, which were all
prophetic as well as symbolic, the rite may&mdash;must
go. Its retention is an anachronism, &ldquo;as if a flower
should shut, and be a bud again.&rdquo; That is a wise
and pregnant principle, but as it comes to the surface
again immediately hereafter, and is applied to a
whole series of subjects, we may defer the consideration
of it, and rather dwell briefly on other matters
suggested by this verse.</p>

<p>We notice, then, the intense moral earnestness
which leads the Apostle here to put the true centre
of gravity of Christianity in moral transformation,
and to set all outward rites and ceremonies in a
very subordinate place. What had Jesus Christ
come from heaven for, and for what had He borne
His bitter passion? To what end were the Colossians
knit to Him by a tie so strong, tender and
strange? Had they been carried into that inmost
depth of union with Him, and were they still to be
laying stress on ceremonies? Had Christ&#8217;s work,
then, no higher issue than to leave religion bound in
the cords of outward observances? Surely Jesus
Christ, who gives men a new life by union with
Himself, which union is brought about through faith
alone, has delivered men from that &ldquo;yoke of bondage,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
if He has done anything at all. Surely they
who are joined to Him should have a profounder
apprehension of the means and the end of their relation
to their Lord than to suppose that it is either
brought about by any outward rite, or has any
reality unless it makes them pure and good. From
that height all questions of external observances
dwindle into insignificance, and all question of sacramental
efficacy drops away of itself. The vital
centre lies in our being joined to Jesus Christ&mdash;the
condition of which is faith in Him, and the outcome
of it a new life which delivers us from the dominion
of the flesh. How far away from such conceptions
of Christianity are those which busy themselves on
either side with matters of detail, with punctilios of
observance, and pedantries of form? The hatred of
forms may be as completely a form as the most
elaborate ritual&mdash;and we all need to have our eyes
turned away from these to the far higher thing, the
worship and service offered by a transformed nature.</p>

<p>We notice again, that the conquest of the animal
nature and the material body is the certain outcome
of true union with Christ, and of that alone.</p>

<p>Paul did not regard matter as necessarily evil, as
these teachers at Colossæ did, nor did he think of
the body as the source of all sin. But he knew that
the fiercest and most fiery temptations came from
it, and that the foulest and most indelible stains on
conscience were splashed from the mud which it
threw. We all know that too. It is a matter of
life and death for each of us to find some means of
taming and holding in the animal that is in us all.
We all know of wrecked lives, which have been driven
on the rocks by the wild passions belonging to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
flesh. Fortune, reputation, health, everything are
sacrificed by hundreds of men, especially young men,
at the sting of this imperious lust. The budding
promise of youth, innocence, hope, and all which
makes life desirable and a nature fair, are trodden
down by the hoofs of the brute. There is no need
to speak of that. And when we come to add to
this the weaknesses of the flesh, and the needs of the
flesh, and the limitations of the flesh, and to remember
how often high purposes are frustrated by
its shrinking from toil, and how often mists born
from its undrained swamps darken the vision that
else might gaze on truth and God, we cannot but
feel that we do not need to be Eastern Gnostics, to
believe that goodness requires the flesh to be subdued.
Every one who has sought for self-improvement
recognises the necessity. But no asceticisms
and no resolves will do what we want. Much repression
may be effected by sheer force of will, but
it is like a man holding a wolf by the jaws. The
arms begin to ache and the grip to grow slack, and
he feels his strength ebbing, and knows that, as soon
as he lets go, the brute will fly at his throat. Repression
is not taming. Nothing tames the wild
beast in us but the power of Christ. He binds it in
a silken lash, and that gentle constraint is strong,
because the fierceness is gone. &ldquo;The wolf also shall
dwell with the lamb, and a little child shall lead
them.&rdquo; The power of union with Christ, and that
alone, will enable us to put off the body of the flesh.
And such union will certainly lead to such crucifying
of the animal nature. Christianity would be
easy if it were a round of observances; it would be
comparatively easy if it were a series of outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
asceticisms. Anybody can fast or wear a hair shirt,
if he have motive sufficient; but the &ldquo;putting off
the body of the flesh&rdquo; which is &ldquo;not made with
hands,&rdquo; is a different and harder thing. Nothing
else avails. High-flown religious emotion, or clear
theological definitions, or elaborate ceremonial worship,
may all have their value; but a religion which
includes them all, and leaves out the plain moralities
of subduing the flesh, and keeping our heel well
pressed down on the serpent&#8217;s head, is worthless. If
we are in Christ, we shall not live in the flesh.</p>

<p>II. The Apostle meets the false teaching of the
need for circumcision, by a second consideration;
namely, a reference to Christian Baptism, as being
the Christian sign of that inward change.</p>

<p>Ye were circumcised, says he&mdash;being buried with
Him in baptism. The form of expression in the
Greek implies that the two things are cotemporaneous.
As if he had said&mdash;Do you want any
further rite to express that mighty change which
passed on you when you came to be &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo;?
You have been baptised, does not that express all
the meaning that circumcision ever had, and much
more? What can you want with the less significant
rite when you have the more significant? This
reference to baptism is quite consistent with what
has been said as to the subordinate importance of
ritual. Some forms we must have, if there is to be
any outward visible Church, and Christ has yielded
to the necessity, and given us two, of which the one
symbolises the initial spiritual act of the Christian
life, and the other the constantly repeated process of
Christian nourishment. They are symbols and outward
representations, nothing more. They convey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
grace, in so far as they help us to realise more
clearly and to feel more deeply the facts on which
our spiritual life is fed, but they are not channels of
grace in any other way than any other outward acts
of worship may be.</p>

<p>We see that the form of baptism here presupposed
is by immersion, and that the form is regarded
as significant. All but entire unanimity prevails
among commentators on this point. The burial and
the resurrection spoken of point unmistakably to the
primitive mode of baptism, as Bishop Lightfoot, the
latest and best English expositor of this book, puts
it in his paraphrase: &ldquo;Ye were buried with Christ to
your old selves beneath the baptismal waters, and
were raised with Him from these same waters, to a
new and better life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If so, two questions deserve consideration&mdash;first,
is it right to alter a form which has a meaning that
is lost by the change? second, can we alter a significant
form without destroying it? Is the new
thing rightly called by the old name? If baptism
be immersion, and immersion express a substantial
part of its meaning, can sprinkling or pouring be
baptism?</p>

<p>Again, baptism is associated in time with the inward
change, which is the true circumcision. There
are but two theories on which these two things are
cotemporaneous. The one is the theory that baptism
effects the change, the other is the theory that
baptism goes with the change as its sign. The
association is justified if men are &ldquo;circumcised,&rdquo; that
is, changed when they are baptised, or if men are
baptised when they have been &ldquo;circumcised.&rdquo; No
other theory gives full weight to these words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
The former theory elevates baptism into more
than the importance of which Paul sought to deprive
circumcision, it confuses the distinction between the
Church and the world, it lulls men into a false
security, it obscures the very central truth of Christianity&mdash;namely
that faith in Christ, working by love,
makes a Christian&mdash;it gives the basis for a portentous
reproduction of sacerdotalism, and it is shivered
to pieces against the plain facts of daily life. But it
may be worth while to notice in a sentence, that it
is conclusively disposed of by the language before
us&mdash;it is &ldquo;through faith in the operation of God&rdquo;
that we are raised again in baptism. Not the rite,
then, but faith is the means of this participation
with Christ in burial and resurrection. What remains
but that baptism is associated with that
spiritual change by which we are delivered from the
body of the flesh, because in the Divine order it is
meant to be the outward symbol of that change
which is effected by no rite or sacrament, but by
faith alone, uniting us to the transforming Christ?</p>

<p>We observe the solemnity and the thoroughness of
the change thus symbolised. It is more than a circumcision.
It is burial and a resurrection, an entire
dying of the old self by union with Christ, a real and
present rising again by participation in His risen life.
This and nothing less makes a Christian. We partake
of His death, inasmuch as we ally ourselves to
it by our faith, as the sacrifice for our sins, and make
it the ground of all our hope. But that is not all.
We partake of His death, inasmuch as, by the power
of His cross, we are drawn to sever ourselves from
the selfish life, and to slay our own old nature; dying
for His dear sake to the habits, tastes, desires and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
purposes in which we lived. Self-crucifixion for the
love of Christ is the law for us all. His cross is the
pattern for our conduct, as well as the pledge and
means of our acceptance. We must die to sin that
we may live to righteousness. We must die to self,
that we may live to God and our brethren. We have
no right to trust in Christ <i>for</i> us, except as we have
Christ <i>in</i> us. His cross is not saving us from our guilt,
unless it is moulding our lives to some faint likeness
of Him who died that we might live, and might live
a real life by dying daily to the world, sin, and
self.</p>

<p>If we are thus made conformable to His death, we
shall know the power of His resurrection, in all its
aspects. It will be to us the guarantee of our own,
and we shall know its power as a prophecy for our
future. It will be to us the seal of His perfect work
on the cross, and we shall know its power as God&#8217;s
token of acceptance of His sacrifice in the past. It
will be to us the type of our spiritual resurrection
now, and we shall know its power as the pattern and
source of our supernatural life in the present. Thus
we must die in and with Christ that we may live in
and with Him, and that twofold process is the very
heart of personal religion. No lofty participation in
the immortal hopes which spring from the empty
grave of Jesus is warranted, unless we have His
quickening power raising us to-day by a better resurrection;
and no participation in the present power
of His heavenly life is possible, unless we have such
a share in His death, as that by it the world is
crucified to us, and we unto the world.</p>

<p>III. The Apostle adds another phase of this great
contrast of life and death, which brings home still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
more closely to his hearers, the deep and radical
change which passes upon all Christians. He has
been speaking of a death and burial followed by a
resurrection. But there is another death from which
Christ raises us, by that same risen life imparted
to us through faith&mdash;a darker and grimmer thing
than the self-abnegation before described.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, being dead through your trespasses,
and the uncircumcision of your flesh.&rdquo; The separate
acts of transgression of which they had been guilty,
and the unchastened, unpurified, carnal nature from
which these had flowed, were the reasons of a very
real and awful death; or, as the parallel passage in
Ephesians (ii. 2) puts it with a slight variation, they
made the condition or sphere in which that death
inhered. That solemn thought, so pregnant in its
dread emphasis in Scripture, is not to be put aside as
a mere metaphor. All life stands in union with
God. The physical universe exists by reason of its
perpetual contact with His sustaining hand, in the
hollow of which all Being lies, and it is, because He
touches it. &ldquo;In Him we live.&rdquo; So also the life of
mind is sustained by His perpetual inbreathing, and
in the deepest sense &ldquo;we see light&rdquo; in His light.
So, lastly, the highest life of the spirit stands in union
in still higher manner with Him, and to be separated
from Him is death to it. Sin breaks that union, and
therefore sin is death, in the very inmost centre of
man&#8217;s being. The awful warning, &ldquo;In the day thou
eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,&rdquo; was fulfilled.
That separation by sin, in which the soul is wrenched
from God, is the real death, and the thing that men
call by the name is only an outward symbol of a far
sadder fact&mdash;the shadow of that which is the awful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
substance, and as much less terrible than it as painted
fires are less than the burning reality.</p>

<p>So men may live in the body, and toil and think
and feel, and be dead. The world is full of &ldquo;sheeted
dead,&rdquo; that &ldquo;squeak and gibber&rdquo; in &ldquo;our streets,&rdquo;
for every soul that lives to self and has rent itself
away from God, so far as a creature can, is &ldquo;dead
while he liveth.&rdquo; The other death, of which the
previous verse spoke, is therefore but the putting off
of a death. We lose nothing of real life in putting off
self, but only that which keeps us in a separation from
God, and slays our true and highest being. To die
to self is but &ldquo;the death of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same life of which the previous verse spoke
as coming from the risen Lord is here set forth as
able to raise us from that death of sin. &ldquo;He hath
quickened you together with Him.&rdquo; Union with
Christ floods our dead souls with His own vitality,
as water will pour from a reservoir through a tube
inserted in it. There is the actual communication
of a new life when we touch Christ by faith. The
prophet of old laid himself upon the dead child, the
warm lip on the pallid mouth, the throbbing heart
on the still one, and the contact rekindled the extinguished
spark. So Christ lays His full life on
our deadness, and does more than recall a departed
glow of vitality. He communicates a new life kindred
with His own. That life makes us free here
and now from the law of sin and death, and it shall
be perfected hereafter when the working of His
mighty power shall change the body of our humiliation
into the likeness of the body of His glory, and
the leaven of His new life shall leaven the three
measures in which it is hidden, body, soul, and spirit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with its own transforming energy. Then, in yet
higher sense, death shall die, and life shall be victor
by His victory.</p>

<p>But to all this one preliminary is needful&mdash;&ldquo;having
forgiven us all trespasses.&rdquo; Paul&#8217;s eagerness to associate
himself with his brethren, and to claim his
share in the forgiveness, as well as to unite in the
acknowledgment of sin, makes him change his word
from &ldquo;you&rdquo; to &ldquo;us.&rdquo; So the best manuscripts give
the text, and the reading is obviously full of interest
and suggestiveness. There must be a removal of the
cause of deadness before there can be a quickening
to new life. That cause was sin, which cannot be
cancelled as guilt by any self-denial however great,
nor even by the impartation of a new life from God
for the future. A gospel which only enjoined dying
to self would be as inadequate as a gospel which only
provided for a higher life in the future. The stained
and faultful past must be cared for. Christ must
bring pardon for it, as well as a new spirit for
the future. So the condition prior to our being
quickened together with Him is God&#8217;s forgiveness,
free and universal, covering all our sins, and given to
us without anything on our part. That condition is
satisfied. Christ&#8217;s death brings to us God&#8217;s pardon,
and when the great barrier of unforgiven sin is
cleared away, Christ&#8217;s life pours into our hearts, and
&ldquo;everything lives whithersoever the river cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here then we have the deepest ground of Paul&#8217;s
intense hatred of every attempt to make anything
but faith in Christ and moral purity essential to the
perfect Christian life. Circumcision and baptism
and all other rites or sacraments of Judaism or
Christianity are equally powerless to quicken dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
souls. For that, the first thing needed is the forgiveness
of sins, and that is ours through simple
faith in Christ&#8217;s death. We are quickened by
Christ&#8217;s own life in us, and He &ldquo;dwells in our hearts
by faith.&rdquo; All ordinances may be administered to
us a hundred times, and without faith they leave us
as they found us&mdash;dead. If we have hold of Christ
by faith we live, whether we have received the
ordinances or not. So all full blown or budding
sacramentarianism is to be fought against to the
uttermost, because it tends to block the road to the
City of Refuge for a poor sinful soul, and the most
pressing of all necessities is that that way of life
should be kept clear and unimpeded.</p>

<p>We need the profound truth which lies in the
threefold form which Paul gives to one of his great
watchwords: &ldquo;Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision
is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments
of God.&rdquo; And how, says my despairing
conscience, shall I keep the commandments? The
answer lies in the second form of the saying&mdash;&ldquo;In
Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.&rdquo; And how,
replies my saddened heart, can I become a new
creature? The answer lies in the final form of
the saying&mdash;&ldquo;In Jesus Christ neither circumcision
availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which
worketh.&rdquo; Faith brings the life which makes us new
men, and then we can keep the commandments. If
we have faith, and are new men and do God&#8217;s will,
we need no rites but as helps. If we have not faith,
all rites are nothing.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE CROSS THE DEATH OF LAW AND THE TRIUMPH
OVER EVIL POWERS.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show
of them openly, triumphing over them in it.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii. 14, 15 (Rev.
Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The same double reference to the two characteristic
errors of the Colossians which we have
already met so frequently, presents itself here.
This whole section vibrates continually between
warnings against the Judaising enforcement of the
Mosaic law on Gentile Christians, and against the
Oriental figments about a crowd of angelic beings
filling the space betwixt man and God, betwixt
pure spirit and gross matter. One great fact is here
opposed to these strangely associated errors. The
cross of Christ is the abrogation of the Law; the
cross of Christ is the victory over principalities and
powers. If we hold fast by it, we are under no
subjection to the former, and have neither to fear
nor reverence the latter.</p>

<p>I. The Cross of Christ is the death of Law.</p>

<p>The law is a written document. It has an
antagonistic aspect to us all, Gentiles as well as
Jews. Christ has blotted it out. More than that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
He has taken it out of the way, as if it were an
obstacle lying right in the middle of our path.
More than that, it is &ldquo;nailed to the cross.&rdquo; That
phrase has been explained by an alleged custom of
repealing laws and cancelling bonds by driving a
nail into them, and fixing them up in public, but
proof of the practice is said to be wanting. The
thought seems to be deeper than that. This antagonistic
&ldquo;law&rdquo; is conceived of as being, like &ldquo;the
world,&rdquo; crucified in the crucifixion of our Lord.
The nails which fastened Him to the cross fastened
it, and in His death it was done to death. We are
free from it, &ldquo;that being dead in which we were held.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have first, then, to consider the &ldquo;handwriting,&rdquo;
or, as some would render the word, &ldquo;the bond.&rdquo; Of
course, by <i>law</i> here is primarily meant the Mosaic
ceremonial law, which was being pressed upon the
Colossians. It is so completely antiquated for us,
that we have difficulty in realising what a fight for
life and death raged round the question of its
observance by the primitive Church. It is always
harder to change customs than creeds, and religious
observances live on, as every maypole on a village
green tells us, long after the beliefs which animated
them are forgotten. So there was a strong body
among the early believers to whom it was flat
blasphemy to speak of allowing the Gentile
Christian to come into the Church, except through
the old doorway of circumcision, and to whom the
outward ceremonial of Judaism was the only visible
religion. That is the point directly at issue between
Paul and these teachers.</p>

<p>But the modern distinction between moral and
ceremonial law had no existence in Paul&#8217;s mind, any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
more than it has in the Old Testament, where
precepts of the highest morality and regulations of
the merest ceremonial are interstratified in a way
most surprising to us moderns. To him the law
was a homogeneous whole, however diverse its
commands, because it was all the revelation of the
will of God for the guidance of man. It is the
law as a whole, in all its aspects and parts, that is
here spoken of, whether as enjoining morality, or
external observances, or as an accuser fastening guilt
on the conscience, or as a stern prophet of retribution
and punishment.</p>

<p>Further, we must give a still wider extension to
the thought. The principles laid down are true
not only in regard to &ldquo;<i>the</i> law,&rdquo; but about all law,
whether it be written on the tables of stone, or on
&ldquo;the fleshy tables of the heart&rdquo; or conscience, or in
the systems of ethics, or in the customs of society.
Law, as such, howsoever enacted and whatever the
bases of its rule, is dealt with by Christianity in
precisely the same way as the venerable and God-given
code of the Old Testament. When we
recognise that fact, these discussions in Paul&#8217;s
Epistles flash up into startling vitality and interest.
It has long since been settled that Jewish ritual
is nothing to us. But it ever remains a burning
question for each of us, What Christianity does for
us in relation to the solemn law of duty under
which we are all placed, and which we have all
broken?</p>

<p>The antagonism of law is the next point presented
by these words. Twice, to add to the
emphasis, Paul tells us that the law is against us.
It stands opposite us fronting us and frowning at us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and barring our road. Is &ldquo;law&rdquo; then become our
&ldquo;enemy because it tells us the truth?&rdquo; Surely
this conception of law is a strange contrast to and
descent from the rapturous delight of psalmists and
prophets in the &ldquo;law of the Lord.&rdquo; Surely God&#8217;s
greatest gift to man is the knowledge of His will,
and law is beneficent, a light and a guide to men,
and even its strokes are merciful. Paul believed
all that too. But nevertheless the antagonism is
very real. As with God, so with law, if we be
against Him, He cannot but be against us. We
may make Him our dearest friend or our foe.
&ldquo;They rebelled ... therefore He was turned to
be their enemy and fought against them.&rdquo; The
revelation of duty to which we are not inclined is
ever unwelcome. Law is against us, because it
comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither
putting the inclination into our hearts, nor the
power into our hands. And law is against us,
because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the
accusation of the defaulter and a revelation to him
of his guilt. And law is against us, because it
comes with threatenings and foretastes of penalty
and pain. Thus as standard, accuser and avenger,
it is&mdash;sad perversion of its nature and function
though such an attitude be&mdash;against us.</p>

<p>We all know that. Strange and tragic it is, but
alas! it is true, that God&#8217;s law presents itself before
us as an enemy. Each of us has seen that apparition,
severe in beauty, like the sword-bearing angel
that Balaam saw &ldquo;standing in the way&rdquo; between
the vineyards, blocking our path when we wanted
to &ldquo;go frowardly in the way of our heart.&rdquo; Each
of us knows what it is to see our sentence in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
stern face. The law of the Lord should be to us
&ldquo;sweeter than honey and the honeycomb,&rdquo; but the
corruption of the best is the worst, and we can make
it poison. Obeyed, it is as the chariot of fire to
bear us heavenward. Disobeyed, it is an iron car
that goes crashing on its way, crushing all who set
themselves against it. To know what we ought to
be and to love and try to be it, is blessedness, but
to know it and to refuse to be it, is misery. In
herself she &ldquo;wears the Godhead&#8217;s most benignant
grace,&rdquo; but if we turn against her, Law, the &ldquo;daughter
of the voice of God,&rdquo; gathers frowns upon her face
and her beauty becomes stern and threatening.</p>

<p>But the great principle here asserted is&mdash;the
destruction of law in the cross of Christ. The cross
ends the law&#8217;s power of <i>punishment</i>. Paul believed
that the burden and penalty of sin had been laid on
Jesus Christ and borne by Him on His cross. In
deep, mysterious, but most real identification of
Himself with the whole race of man, He not only
Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,
by the might of His sympathy and the reality of His
manhood, but &ldquo;the Lord made to meet upon Him
the iniquity of us all&rdquo;; and He, the Lamb of God,
willingly accepted the load, and bare away our sins
by bearing their penalty.</p>

<p>To philosophise on that teaching of Scripture is
not my business here. It is my business to assert
it. We can never penetrate to a full understanding
of the rationale of Christ&#8217;s bearing the world&#8217;s sins,
but that has nothing to do with the earnestness of
our belief in the fact. Enough for us that in His
person He willingly made experience of all the bitterness
of sin: that when He agonised in the dark on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the cross, and when from out of the darkness came
that awful cry, so strangely compact of wistful confidence
and utter isolation, &ldquo;My God, My God, why
hast Thou forsaken Me?&rdquo; it was something deeper
than physical pain or shrinking from physical death
that found utterance&mdash;even the sin-laden consciousness
of Him who in that awful hour gathered into
His own breast the spear-points of a world&#8217;s punishment.
The cross of Christ is the endurance of the
penalty of sin, and therefore is the unloosing of the
grip of the law upon us, in so far as threatening and
punishment are concerned. It is not enough that
we should only intellectually recognise that as a
principle&mdash;it is the very heart of the gospel, the
very life of our souls. Trusting ourselves to that
great sacrifice, the dread of punishment will fade
from our hearts, and the thunder-clouds melt out of
the sky, and the sense of guilt will not be a sting,
but an occasion for lowly thankfulness, and the law
will have to draw the bolts of her prison-house and
let our captive souls go free.</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s cross is the end of law as <i>ceremonial</i>. The
whole elaborate ritual of the Jew had sacrifice for its
vital centre, and the prediction of the Great Sacrifice
for its highest purpose. Without the admission of
these principles, Paul&#8217;s position is unintelligible, for
he holds, as in this context, that Christ&#8217;s coming puts
the whole system out of date, because it fulfils it all.
When the fruit has set, there is no more need for
petals; or, as the Apostle himself puts it, &ldquo;when
that which is perfect is come, that which is in part is
done away.&rdquo; We have the reality, and do not need
the shadow. There is but one temple for the Christian
soul&mdash;the &ldquo;temple of His body.&rdquo; Local sanctity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
is at an end, for it was never more than an external
picture of that spiritual fact which is realised in the
Incarnation. Christ is the dwelling-place of Deity,
the meeting-place of God and man, the place of
sacrifice; and, builded on Him, we in Him become
a spiritual house. There are none other temples
than these. Christ is the great priest, and in His
presence all human priesthood loses its consecration,
for it could offer only external sacrifice, and secure a
local approach to a &ldquo;worldly sanctuary.&rdquo; He is the
real Aaron, and we in Him become a royal priesthood.
There are none other priests than these.
Christ is the true sacrifice. His death is the real
propitiation for sin, and we in Him become thank-offerings,
moved by His mercies to present ourselves
living sacrifices. There are none other offerings than
these. So the law as a code of ceremonial worship
is done to death in the cross, and, like the temple
veil, is torn in two from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s cross is the end of law as <i>moral</i> rule.
Nothing in Paul&#8217;s writings warrants the restriction to
the ceremonial law of the strong assertion in the
text, and its many parallels. Of course, such words
do not mean that Christian men are freed from the
obligations of morality, but they do mean that we
are not bound to do the &ldquo;things contained in the
law&rdquo; because they are there. Duty is duty now
because we see the pattern of conduct and character
in Christ. Conscience is not our standard, nor is
the Old Testament conception of the perfect ideal
of manhood. We have neither to read law in the
fleshy tables of the heart, nor in the tables graven
by God&#8217;s own finger, nor in men&#8217;s parchments and
prescriptions. Our law is the perfect life and death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of Christ, who is at once the ideal of humanity and
the reality of Deity.</p>

<p>The weakness of all law is that it merely commands,
but has no power to get its commandments
obeyed. Like a discrowned king, it posts its proclamations,
but has no army at its back to execute
them. But Christ puts His own power within us,
and His love in our hearts; and so we pass from
under the dominion of an external commandment
into the liberty of an inward spirit. He is to His
followers both &ldquo;law and impulse.&rdquo; He gives not
the &ldquo;law of a carnal commandment, but the power
of an endless life.&rdquo; The long schism between inclination
and duty is at an end, in so far as we are
under the influence of Christ&#8217;s cross. The great
promise is fulfilled, &ldquo;I will put My law into their
minds and write it in their hearts&rdquo;; and so, glad
obedience with the whole power of the new life, for
the sake of the love of the dear Lord who has
bought us by His death, supersedes the constrained
submission to outward precept. A higher morality
ought to characterise the partakers of the life of
Christ, who have His example for their code, and
His love for their motive. The tender voice that
says, &ldquo;If ye love Me, keep My commandments,&rdquo;
wins us to purer and more self-sacrificing goodness
than the stern accents that can only say, &ldquo;Thou
shalt&mdash;or else!&rdquo; can ever enforce. He came &ldquo;not
to destroy, but to fulfil.&rdquo; The fulfilment was destruction
in order to reconstruction in higher form.
Law died with Christ on the cross in order that it
might rise and reign with Him in our inmost hearts.</p>

<p>II. The Cross is the triumph over all the powers
of evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
There are considerable difficulties in the interpretation
of verse 15; the main question being the
meaning of the word rendered in the Authorized
Version &ldquo;spoiled,&rdquo; and in the R. V. &ldquo;having put
off from Himself.&rdquo; It is the same word as is used
in iii. 9, and is there rendered &ldquo;have put off&rdquo;;
while a cognate noun is found in verse 11 of this
chapter, and is there translated &ldquo;the putting off.&rdquo;
The form here must either mean &ldquo;having put off
from oneself,&rdquo; or &ldquo;having stripped (others) <i>for</i> oneself.&rdquo;
The former meaning is adopted by many
commentators, as well as by the R. V., and is explained
to mean that Christ having assumed our
humanity, was, as it were, wrapped about and
invested with Satanic temptations, which He finally
flung from Him for ever in His death, which was
His triumph over the powers of evil. The figure
seems far-fetched and obscure, and the rendering
necessitates the supposition of a change in the
person spoken of, which must be God in the earlier
part of the period, and Christ in the latter.</p>

<p>But if we adopt the other meaning, which has
equal warrant in the Greek form, &ldquo;having stripped
for Himself,&rdquo; we get the thought that in the cross,
God has, for His greater glory, stripped principalities
and powers. Taking this meaning, we avoid the
necessity of supposing with Bishop Lightfoot that
there is a change of subject from God to Christ
at some point in the period including verses 13 to
15&mdash;an expedient which is made necessary by the
impossibility of supposing that God &ldquo;divested Himself
of principalities or powers&rdquo;&mdash;and also avoid the
other necessity of referring the whole period to
Christ, which is another way out of that impossibility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
We thereby obtain a more satisfactory meaning than
that Christ in assuming humanity was assailed by
temptations from the powers of evil which were, as
it were, a poisoned garment clinging to Him, and
which He stripped off from Himself in His death.
Further, such a meaning as that which we adopt
makes the whole verse a consistent metaphor in
three stages, whereas the other introduces an utterly
incongruous and irrelevant figure. What connection
has the figure of stripping off a garment with that
of a conqueror in his triumphal procession? But
if we read &ldquo;spoiled for Himself principalities and
powers,&rdquo; we see the whole process before our eyes&mdash;the
victor stripping his foes of arms and ornaments
and dress, then parading them as his captives, and
then dragging them at the wheels of his triumphal
car.</p>

<p>The words point us into dim regions of which we
know nothing more than Scripture tells us. These
dreamers at Colossæ had much to say about a crowd
of beings, bad and good, which linked men and
matter with spirit and God. We have heard already
the emphasis with which Paul has claimed for his
Master the sovereign authority of Creator over all
orders of being, the headship over all principality
and power. He has declared, too, that from Christ&#8217;s
cross a magnetic influence streams out upwards as
well as earthwards, binding all things together in
the great reconciliation&mdash;and now he tells us that
from that same cross shoot downwards darts of
conquering power which subdue and despoil reluctant
foes of other realms and regions than ours, in so
far as they work among men.</p>

<p>That there are such seems plainly enough asserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in Christ&#8217;s own words. However much discredit
has been brought on the thought by monastic and
Puritan exaggerations, it is clearly the teaching of
Scripture; and however it may be ridiculed or set
aside, it can never be disproved.</p>

<p>But the position which Christianity takes in
reference to the whole matter is to maintain that
Christ has conquered the banded kingdom of evil,
and that no man owes it fear or obedience, if he
will only hold fast by his Lord. In the cross is the
judgment of this world, and by it is the prince of
this world cast out. He has taken away the power
of these Powers who were so mighty amongst men.
They held men captive by temptations too strong
to be overcome, but He has conquered the lesser
temptations of the wilderness and the sorer of the
cross, and therein has made us more than conquerors.
They held men captive by ignorance of God, and
the cross reveals Him; by the lie that sin was a
trifle, but the cross teaches us its gravity and power;
by the opposite lie that sin was unforgivable, but
the cross brings pardon for every transgression and
cleansing for every stain. By the cross the world is
a redeemed world, and, as our Lord said in words
which may have suggested the figure of our text, the
strong man is bound, and his house <i>spoiled</i> of all his
armour wherein he trusted. The prey is taken from
the mighty and men are delivered from the dominion
of evil. So that dark kingdom is robbed of its
subjects and its rulers impoverished and restrained.
The devout imagination of the monk-painter drew
on the wall of the cell in his convent the conquering
Christ with white banner bearing a blood-red cross,
before whose glad coming the heavy doors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
prison-house fell from their hinges, crushing beneath
their weight the demon jailer, while the long file of
eager captives, from Adam onwards through ages
of patriarchs and psalmists and prophets, hurried
forward with outstretched hands to meet the
Deliverer, who came bearing His own atmosphere of
radiance and joy. Christ has conquered. His cross
is His victory; and in that victory God has conquered.
As the long files of the triumphal procession
swept upwards to the temple with incense and
music, before the gazing eyes of a gathered glad
nation, while the conquered trooped chained behind
the chariot, that all men might see their fierce eyes
gleaming beneath their matted hair, and breathe more
freely for the chains on their hostile wrists, so in the
world-wide issues of the work of Christ, God triumphs
before the universe, and enhances His glory in that
He has rent the prey from the mighty and won
men back to Himself.</p>

<p>So we learn to think of evil as conquered, and for
ourselves in our own conflicts with the world, the
flesh, and the devil, as well as for the whole race of
man, to be of good cheer. True, the victory is but
slowly being realised in all its consequences, and
often it seems as if no territory had been won. But
the main position has been carried, and though the
struggle is still obstinate, it can end only in one
way. The brute dies hard, but the naked heel of
our Christ has bruised his head, and though still the
dragon</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>his death will come sooner or later. The regenerating
power is lodged in the heart of humanity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the centre from which it flows is the cross. The
history of the world thenceforward is but the history
of its more or less rapid assimilation of that power,
and of its consequent deliverance from the bondage
in which it has been held. The end can only be the
entire and universal manifestation of the victory
which was won when He bowed His head and died.
Christ&#8217;s cross is God&#8217;s throne of triumph.</p>

<p>Let us see that we have our own personal part
in that victory. Holding to Christ, and drawing
from Him by faith a share in His new life, we shall
no longer be under the yoke of law, but enfranchised
into the obedience of love, which is liberty. We
shall no longer be slaves of evil, but sons and
servants of our conquering God, who woos and
wins us by showing us all His love in Christ, and
by giving us His own Son on the Cross, our peace-offering.
If we let Him overcome, His victory will
be life, not death. He will strip us of nothing but
rags, and clothe us in garments of purity; He will
so breathe beauty into us that He will show us
openly to the universe as examples of His transforming
power, and He will bind us glad captives to
His chariot wheels, partakers of His victory as well
as trophies of His all-conquering love. &ldquo;Now
thanks be unto God, which always triumphs over
us in Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect
of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day: which are a shadow of
things to come; but the body is Christ&#8217;s. Let no man rob you of your
prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in
the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and
not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and
knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth with the increase
of God.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> ii. 16&ndash;19 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Let no man <i>therefore</i> judge you.&rdquo; That &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;
sends us back to what the Apostle has
been saying in the previous verses, in order to find
there the ground of these earnest warnings. That
ground is the whole of the foregoing exposition of
the Christian relation to Christ as far back as
verse 9, but especially the great truths contained in
the immediately preceding verses, that the cross of
Christ is the death of law, and God&#8217;s triumph over
all the powers of evil. Because it is so, the
Colossian Christians are exhorted to claim and use
their emancipation from both. Thus we have here
the very heart and centre of the practical counsels
of the Epistle&mdash;the double blasts of the trumpet
warning against the two most pressing dangers
besetting the Church. They are the same two
which we have often met already&mdash;on the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hand, a narrow Judaising enforcement of ceremonial
and punctilios of outward observance; on the other
hand, a dreamy Oriental absorption in imaginations
of a crowd of angelic mediators obscuring the one
gracious presence of Christ our Intercessor.</p>

<p>I. Here then we have first, the claim for Christian
liberty, with the great truth on which it is built.</p>

<p>The points in regard to which that liberty is to be
exercised are specified. They are no doubt those,
in addition to circumcision, which were principally
in question then and there. &ldquo;Meat and drink&rdquo;
refers to restrictions in diet, such as the prohibition
of &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; things in the Mosaic law, and the
question of the lawfulness of eating meat offered
to idols; perhaps also, such as the Nazarite vow.
There were few regulations as to &ldquo;drink&rdquo; in the Old
Testament, so that probably other ascetic practices
besides the Mosaic regulations were in question, but
these must have been unimportant, else Paul could
not have spoken of the whole as being a &ldquo;shadow
of things to come.&rdquo; The second point in regard to
which liberty is here claimed is that of the sacred
seasons of Judaism: the annual festivals, the monthly
feast of the new moon, the weekly Sabbath.</p>

<p>The relation of the Gentile converts to these
Jewish practices was an all-important question for the
early Church. It was really the question whether
Christianity was to be more than a Jewish sect&mdash;and
the main force which, under God, settled the
contest, was the vehemence and logic of the Apostle
Paul.</p>

<p>Here he lays down the ground on which that whole
question about diet and days, and all such matters, is
to be settled. They &ldquo;are a shadow of things to come&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but the body is of Christ. &ldquo;Coming events cast
their shadows <i>before</i>.&rdquo; That great work of Divine
love, the mission of Christ, Whose &ldquo;goings forth
have been from everlasting,&rdquo; may be thought of as
having set out from the Throne as soon as time was,
travelling in the greatness of its strength, like the
beams of some far-off star that have not yet
reached a dark world. The light from the Throne
is behind Him as He advances across the centuries,
and the shadow is thrown far in front.</p>

<p>Now that involves two thoughts about the Mosaic
law and whole system. First, the purely prophetic
and symbolic character of the Old Testament order,
and especially of the Old Testament ritual. The
absurd extravagance of many attempts to &ldquo;spiritualize&rdquo;
the latter should not blind us to the truth
which they caricature. Nor, on the other hand,
should we be so taken with new attempts to reconstruct
our notions of Jewish history and the
dates of Old Testament books, as to forget that,
though the New Testament is committed to no
theory on these points, it is committed to the Divine
origin and prophetic purpose of the Mosaic law and
Levitical worship. We should thankfully accept all
teaching which free criticism and scholarship can
give us as to the process by which, and the time
when, that great symbolic system of acted prophecy
was built up; but we shall be further away than
ever from understanding the Old Testament if we
have gained critical knowledge of its genesis, and
have lost the belief that its symbols were given by
God to prophesy of His Son. That is the key to
both Testaments; and I cannot but believe that
the uncritical reader who reads his book of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
law and the prophets with that conviction, has got
nearer the very marrow of the book, than the critic,
if he have parted with it, can ever come.</p>

<p>Sacrifice, altar, priest, temple spake of Him. The
distinctions of meats were meant, among other
purposes, to familiarize men with the conceptions
of purity and impurity, and so, by stimulating conscience,
to wake the sense of need of a Purifier.
The yearly feasts set forth various aspects of the
great work of Christ, and the sabbath showed
in outward form the rest into which He leads those
who cease from their own works and wear His yoke.
All these observances, and the whole system to
which they belong, are like out-riders who precede a
prince on his progress, and as they gallop through
sleeping villages, rouse them with the cry, &ldquo;The
king is coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the king <i>has</i> come, where are the
heralds? and when the reality has come, who wants
symbols? and if that which threw the shadow
forward through the ages has arrived, how shall
the shadow be visible too? Therefore the second
principle here laid down, namely the cessation of all
these observances, and their like, is really involved
in the first, namely their prophetic character.</p>

<p>The practical conclusion drawn is very noteworthy,
because it seems much narrower than the premises
warrant. Paul does not say&mdash;therefore let no man
observe any of these any more; but takes up the
much more modest ground&mdash;let no man <i>judge</i> you
about them. He claims a wide liberty of variation,
and all that he repels is the right of anybody to
dragoon Christian men into ceremonial observances
on the ground that they are necessary. He does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
not quarrel with the rites, but with men insisting on
the necessity of the rites.</p>

<p>In his own practice he gave the best commentary
on his meaning. When they said to him, &ldquo;You
<i>must</i> circumcise Titus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Then I will <i>not</i>.&rdquo;
When nobody tried to compel him, he took Timothy,
and of his own accord circumcised him to avoid
scandals. When it was needful as a protest, he rode
right over all the prescriptions of the law, and &ldquo;did
eat with Gentiles.&rdquo; When it was advisable as a
demonstration that he himself &ldquo;walked orderly and
kept the law,&rdquo; he performed the rites of purification
and united in the temple worship.</p>

<p>In times of transition wise supporters of the new
will not be in a hurry to break with the old. &ldquo;I
will lead on softly, according as the flock and the
children be able to endure,&rdquo; said Jacob, and so says
every good shepherd.</p>

<p>The brown sheaths remain on the twig after the
tender green leaf has burst from within them, but
there is no need to pull them off, for they will drop
presently. &ldquo;I will wear three surplices if they like,&rdquo;
said Luther once. &ldquo;Neither if we eat are we the
better, neither if we eat not are we the worse,&rdquo; said
Paul. Such is the spirit of the words here. It is
a plea for Christian liberty. If not insisted on as
necessary, the outward observances may be allowed.
If they are regarded as helps, or as seemly adjuncts
or the like, there is plenty of room for difference
of opinion and for variety of practice, according
to temperament and taste and usage. There are
principles which should regulate even these diversities
of practice, and Paul has set these forth, in the great
chapter about meats in the Epistle to the Romans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
But it is a different thing altogether when any
external observances are insisted on as essential,
either from the old Jewish or from the modern
sacramentarian point of view. If a man comes
saying, &ldquo;Except ye be circumcised, ye cannot be
saved,&rdquo; the only right answer is, Then I will not be
circumcised, and if <i>you</i> are, because you believe that
you cannot be saved without it, &ldquo;Christ is become
of none effect to you.&rdquo; Nothing is necessary but
union to Him, and that comes through no outward
observance, but through the faith which worketh by
love. Therefore, let no man judge you, but repel
all such attempts at thrusting any ceremonial ritual
observances on you, on the plea of necessity, with
the emancipating truth that the cross of Christ is
the death of law.</p>

<p>A few words may be said here on the bearing
of the principles laid down in these verses on the
religious observance of Sunday. The obligation of
the Jewish sabbath has passed away as much as
sacrifices and circumcision. That seems unmistakably
the teaching here. But the institution of a weekly
day of rest is distinctly put in Scripture as independent
of, and prior to, the special form and meaning
given to the institution in the Mosaic law. That
is the natural conclusion from the narrative of the
creative rest in Genesis, and from our Lord&#8217;s emphatic
declaration that the sabbath was made for &ldquo;man&rdquo;&mdash;that
is to say, for the race. Many traces of the pre-Mosaic
sabbath have been adduced, and among
others we may recall the fact that recent researches
show it to have been observed by the Accadians, the
early inhabitants of Assyria. It is a physical and
moral necessity, and that is a sadly mistaken benevolence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which on the plea of culture or amusement for
the many, compels the labour of the few, and breaks
down the distinction between the Sunday and the
rest of the week.</p>

<p>The religious observance of the first day of the
week rests on no recorded command, but has a higher
origin, inasmuch as it is the outcome of a felt want.
The early disciples naturally gathered together for
worship on the day which had become so sacred to
them. At first, no doubt, they observed the Jewish
sabbath, and only gradually came to the practice
which we almost see growing before our eyes in the
Acts of the Apostles, in the mention of the disciples
at Troas coming together on the first day of the
week to break bread, and which we gather, from the
Apostle&#8217;s instructions as to weekly setting apart
money for charitable purposes, to have existed in
the Church at Corinth; as we know, that even in
his lonely island prison far away from the company
of his brethren, the Apostle John was in a condition
of high religious contemplation on the Lord&#8217;s day,
ere yet he heard the solemn voice and saw &ldquo;the
things which are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gradual growing up of the practice is in
accordance with the whole spirit of the New Covenant,
which has next to nothing to say about the externals
of worship, and leaves the new life to shape itself.
Judaism gave prescriptions and minute regulations;
Christianity, the religion of the spirit, gives principles.
The necessity, for the nourishment of the Divine life,
of the religious observance of the day of rest is
certainly not less now than at first. In the hurry
and drive of our modern life with the world forcing
itself on us at every moment, we cannot keep up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the warmth of devotion unless we use this day, not
merely for physical rest, and family enjoyment, but
for worship. They who know their own slothfulness
of spirit, and are in earnest in seeking after a deeper,
fuller Christian life, will thankfully own, &ldquo;the week
were dark but for its light.&rdquo; I distrust the spirituality
which professes that all life is a sabbath, and therefore
holds itself absolved from special seasons of
worship. If the stream of devout communion is to
flow through all our days, there must be frequent
reservoirs along the road, or it will be lost in the
sand, like the rivers of higher Asia. It is a poor
thing to say, keep the day as a day of worship
because it is a commandment. Better to think of
it as a great gift for the highest purposes; and not
let it be merely a day of rest for jaded bodies, but
make it one of refreshment for cumbered spirits,
and rekindle the smouldering flame of devotion,
by drawing near to Christ in public and in private.
So shall we gather stores that may help us to go
in the strength of that meat for some more marches
on the dusty road of life.</p>

<p>II. The Apostle passes on to his second peal of
warning,&mdash;that against the teaching about angel
mediators, which would rob the Colossian Christians
of their prize,&mdash;and draws a rapid portrait of the
teachers of whom they are to beware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let no man rob you of your prize.&rdquo; The
metaphor is the familiar one of the race or the
wrestling ground; the umpire or judge is Christ;
the reward is that incorruptible crown of glory, of
righteousness, woven not of fading bay leaves, but
of sprays from the &ldquo;tree of life,&rdquo; which dower with
undying blessedness the brows round which they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
wreathed. Certain people are trying to rob them
of their prize&mdash;not consciously, for that would be
inconceivable, but such is the tendency of their
teaching. No names will be mentioned, but he
draws a portrait of the robber with swift firm hand,
as if he had said, If you want to know whom I
mean, here he is. Four clauses, like four rapid
strokes of the pencil, do it, and are marked in the
Greek by four participles, the first of which is
obscured in the Authorised Version. &ldquo;Delighting
in humility and the worshipping of angels.&rdquo; So
probably the first clause should be rendered. The
first words are almost contradictory, and are meant
to suggest that the humility has not the genuine
ring about it. Self-conscious humility in which a
man takes delight is not the real thing. A man
who knows that he is humble, and is self-complacent
about it, glancing out of the corners of his downcast
eyes at any mirror where he can see himself, is not
humble at all. &ldquo;The devil&#8217;s darling vice is the
pride which apes humility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So <i>very</i> humble were these people that they
would not venture to pray to God! <i>There</i> was
humility indeed. So far beneath did they feel themselves,
that the utmost they could do was to lay
hold of the lowest link of a long chain of angel
mediators, in hope that the vibration might run
upwards through all the links, and perhaps reach
the throne at last. Such fantastic abasement which
would not take God at His word, nor draw near
to Him in His Son, was really the very height of
pride.</p>

<p>Then follows a second descriptive clause, of which
no altogether satisfactory interpretation has yet been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
given. Possibly, as has been suggested, we have
here an early error in the text, which has affected all
the manuscripts, and cannot now be corrected. Perhaps,
on the whole, the translation adopted by the
Revised Version presents the least difficulty&mdash;&ldquo;dwelling
in the things which he hath seen.&rdquo; In
that case the seeing would be not by the senses, but
by visions and pretended revelations, and the charge
against the false teachers would be that they &ldquo;walked
in a vain show&rdquo; of unreal imaginations and visionary
hallucinations, whose many-coloured misleading
lights they followed rather than the plain sunshine
of revealed facts in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind&rdquo; is the
next feature in the portrait. The self-conscious
humility was only skin deep, and covered the utmost
intellectual arrogance. The heretic teacher, like a
blown bladder, was swollen with what after all was
only wind; he was dropsical from conceit of &ldquo;mind,&rdquo;
or, as we should say, &ldquo;intellectual ability,&rdquo; which
after all was only the instrument and organ of the
&ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; the sinful self. And, of course, being all
these things, he would have no firm grip of Christ,
from whom such tempers and views were sure to
detach him. Therefore the damning last clause of
the indictment is &ldquo;not holding the Head.&rdquo; How
could he do so? And the slackness of his grasp
of the Lord Jesus would make all these errors and
faults ten times worse.</p>

<p>Now the special forms of these errors which are
here dealt with are all gone past recall. But the
tendencies which underlay these special forms are as
rampant as ever, and work unceasingly to loosen our
hold of our dear Lord. The worship of angels is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
dead, but we are still often tempted to think that
we are too lowly and sinful to claim our portion of
the faithful promises of God. The spurious humility
is by no means out of date, which knows better than
God does, whether He can forgive us our sins, and
bend over us in love. We do not slip in angel
mediators between ourselves and Him, but the
tendency to put the sole work of Jesus Christ &ldquo;into
commission,&rdquo; is not dead. We are all tempted to
grasp at others as well as at Him, for our love, and
trust, and obedience, and we all need the reminder
that to lay hold of any other props is to lose hold
of Him, and that he who does not cleave to Christ
alone, does not cleave to Christ at all.</p>

<p>We do not see visions and dream dreams any
more, except here and there some one led astray by a
so-called &ldquo;spiritualism,&rdquo; but plenty of us attach more
importance to our own subjective fancies or speculations
about the obscurer parts of Christianity than to
the clear revelation of God in Christ. The &ldquo;unseen
world&rdquo; has for many minds an unwholesome attraction.
The Gnostic spirit is still in full force among
us, which despises the foundation facts and truths of
the gospel as &ldquo;milk for babes,&rdquo; and values its own
baseless artificial speculations about subordinate
matters, which are unrevealed because they are
subordinate, and fascinating to some minds because
unrevealed, far above the truths which are clear because
they are vital, and insipid to such minds because
they are clear. We need to be reminded that Christianity
is not for speculation, but to make us good,
and that &ldquo;He who has fashioned their hearts alike,&rdquo;
has made us all to live by the same air, to be
nourished by the same bread from heaven, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
saved and purified by the same truth. That is the
gospel which the little child can understand, of
which the outcast and the barbarian can get some
kind of hold, which the failing spirit groping in the
darkness of death can dimly see as its light in the
valley&mdash;that is the all-important part of the gospel.
What needs special training and capacity to understand
is no essential portion of the truth that is
meant for the world.</p>

<p>And a swollen self-conceit is of all things the
most certain to keep a man away from Christ. We
must feel our utter helplessness and need, before we
shall lay hold on Him, and if ever that wholesome
lowly sense of our own emptiness is clouded over,
that moment will our fingers relax their tension, and
that moment will the flow of life into our deadness
run slow and pause. Whatever slackens our hold of
Christ tends to rob us of the final prize, that crown
of life which He gives.</p>

<p>Hence the solemn earnestness of these warnings.
It was not only a doctrine more or less that was at
stake, but it was their eternal life. Certain truths
believed would increase the firmness of their hold
on their Lord, and thereby would secure the prize.
Disbelieved, the disbelief would slacken their grasp
of Him, and thereby would deprive them of it. We
are often told that the gospel gives heaven for right
belief, and that that is unjust. But if a man does
not believe a thing, he cannot have in his character
or feelings the influence which the belief of it would
produce. If he does not believe that Christ died
for his sins, and that all his hopes are built on that
great Saviour, he will not cleave to Him in love and
dependence. If he does not so cleave to Him he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
will not draw from Him the life which would mould
his character and stir him to run the race. If he
do not run the race he will never win nor wear
the crown. That crown is the reward and issue of
character and conduct, made possible by the communication
of strength and new nature from Jesus,
which again is made possible through our faith
laying hold of Him as revealed in certain truths,
and of these truths as revealing Him. Therefore,
intellectual error may loose our hold on Christ, and
if we slacken that, we shall forfeit the prize. Mere
speculative interest about the less plainly revealed
corners of Christian truth may, and often do, act in
paralysing the limbs of the Christian athlete. &ldquo;Ye
did run well, what hath hindered you?&rdquo; has to be
asked of many whom a spirit akin to this described
in our text has made languid in the race. To us
all, knowing in some measure how the whole sum
of influences around us work to detach us from our
Lord, and so to rob us of the prize which is inseparable
from His presence, the solemn exhortation
which He speaks from heaven may well come,
&ldquo;Hold fast that thou hast; let no man take thy
crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The source and manner of all true growth is
next set forth, in order to enforce the warning, and
to emphasize the need of holding the Head.</p>

<p>Christ is not merely represented supreme and
sovereign, when He is called &ldquo;the head.&rdquo; The
metaphor goes much deeper, and points to Him as
the source of a real spiritual life, from Him communicated
to all the members of the true Church, and
constituting it an organic whole. We have found
the same expression twice already in the Epistle;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
once as applied to His relation to &ldquo;the body, the
Church&rdquo; (i. 18), and once in reference to the &ldquo;principalities
and powers.&rdquo; The errors in the Colossian
Church derogated from Christ&#8217;s sole sovereign place
as fountain of all life natural and spiritual for all
orders of beings, and hence the emphasis of the
Apostle&#8217;s proclamation of the counter truth. That
life which flows from the head is diffused through
the whole body by the various and harmonious
action of all the parts. The body is &ldquo;supplied and
knit together,&rdquo; or in other words, the functions of
nutrition and compaction into a whole are performed
by the &ldquo;joints and bands,&rdquo; in which last word are
included muscles, nerves, tendons, and any of the
&ldquo;connecting bands which strap the body together.&rdquo;
Their action is the condition of growth; but the
Head is the source of all which the action of the
members transmits to the body. Christ is the
source of all nourishment. From Him flows the
life-blood which feeds the whole, and by which
every form of supply is ministered whereby the body
grows. Christ is the source of all unity. Churches
have been bound together by other bonds, such as
creeds, polity, or even nationality; but that external
bond is only like a rope round a bundle of fagots,
while the true, inward unity springing from common
possession of the life of Christ, is as the unity of
some great tree, through which the same sap circulates
from massive bole to the tiniest leaf that
dances at the tip of the farthest branch.</p>

<p>These blessed results of supply and unity are
effected through the action of the various parts. If
each organ is in healthy action, the body grows.
There is diversity in offices; the same life is light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the eyes, beauty in the cheek, strength in the
hand, thought in the brain. The more you rise in
the scale of life the more the body is differentiated,
from the simple sac that can be turned inside out
and has no division of parts or offices, up to man.
So in the Church. The effect of Christianity is to
heighten individuality, and to give each man his
own proper &ldquo;gift from God,&rdquo; and therefore each man
his office, &ldquo;one after this manner and another after
that.&rdquo; Therefore is there need for the freest possible
unfolding of each man&#8217;s idiosyncrasy, heightened and
hallowed by an indwelling Christ, lest the body
should be the poorer if any member&#8217;s activity be
suppressed, or any one man be warped from his own
work wherein he is strong, to become a feeble copy
of another&#8217;s. The perfect light is the blending of
all colours.</p>

<p>A community where each member thus holds
firmly by the Head, and each ministers in his degree
to the nourishment and compaction of the members,
will, says Paul, increase with the increase of God.
The increase will come from Him, will be pleasing
to Him, will be essentially the growth of His own
life in the body. There is an increase not of God.
These heretical teachers were swollen with dropsical
self-conceit; but this is wholesome, solid growth.
For individuals and communities of professing Christians
the lesson is always seasonable, that it is very
easy to get an increase of the other kind. The
individual may increase in apparent knowledge, in
volubility, in visions and speculations, in so-called
Christian work; the Church may increase in members,
in wealth, in culture, in influence in the world, in
apparent activities, in subscription lists, and the like&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
it may all be not sound growth, but proud
flesh, which needs the knife. One way only there
is by which we may increase with the increase of
God, and that is that we keep fast hold of Jesus
Christ, and &ldquo;let Him not go, for He is our life.&rdquo;
The one exhortation which includes all that is
needful, and which being obeyed, all ceremonies and
all speculations will drop into their right place, and
become helps, not snares, is the exhortation which
Barnabas gave to the new Gentile converts at
Antioch&mdash;that &ldquo;with purpose of heart they should
cleave unto the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="ColXVI" id="ColXVI"></a>XVI.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>TWO FINAL TESTS OF THE FALSE TEACHING.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as
though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances.
Handle not, nor taste, nor touch (all which things are to perish with the
using), after the precepts and doctrines of men? Which things have
indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to
the body; <i>but are</i> not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span>
ii. 20&ndash;23 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The polemical part of the Epistle is now
coming to an end. We pass in the next
chapter, after a transitional paragraph, to simple
moral precepts which, with personal details, fill up
the remainder of the letter. The antagonist errors
appear for the last time in the words which we have
now to consider. In these the Apostle seems to
gather up all his strength to strike two straight,
crashing, final blows, which pulverize and annihilate
the theoretical positions and practical precepts of the
heretical teachers. First, he puts in the form of an
unanswerable demand for the reason for their teachings,
their radical inconsistency with the Christian&#8217;s
death with Christ, which is the very secret of his life.
Then, by a contemptuous concession of their apparent
value to people who will not look an inch
below the surface, he makes more emphatic their
final condemnation as worthless&mdash;less than nothing
and vanity&mdash;for the suppression of &ldquo;the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
only aim of all moral and religious discipline. So
we have here two great tests by their conformity
to which we may try all teachings which assume to
regulate life, and all Christian teaching about the
place and necessity for ritual and outward prescriptions
of conduct. &ldquo;Ye are dead with Christ.&rdquo; All
must fit in with that great fact. The restraint and
conquest of &ldquo;the flesh&rdquo; is the purpose of all religion
and of all moral teaching&mdash;our systems must do
that or they are naught, however fascinating they
may be.</p>

<p>I. We have then to consider the great fact of the
Christian&#8217;s death with Christ, and to apply it as a
touch-stone.</p>

<p>The language of the Apostle points to a definite
time when the Colossian Christians &ldquo;died&rdquo; with Christ.
That carries us back to former words in the chapter,
where, as we found, the period of their baptism
considered as the symbol and profession of their
conversion, was regarded as the time of their burial.
They died with Christ when they clave with penitent
trust to the truth that Christ died for them. When
a man unites himself by faith to the dying Christ as
his Peace, Pardon, and Saviour, then he too in a
very real sense dies with Jesus.</p>

<p>That thought that every Christian is dead with
Christ, runs through the whole of Paul&#8217;s teaching.
It is no mere piece of mysticism on his lips, though
it has often become so, when divorced from morality,
as it has been by some Christian teachers. It is no
mere piece of rhetoric, though it has often become
so, when men have lost the true thought of what
Christ&#8217;s death is for the world. But to Paul the
cross of Christ was, first and foremost, the altar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sacrifice on which the oblation had been offered that
took away all his guilt and sin; and then, because
it was that, it became the law of his own life, and
the power that assimilated him to his Lord.</p>

<p>The plain English of it all is, that when a man
becomes a Christian by putting his trust in Christ
Who died, as the ground of his acceptance and salvation,
such a change takes place upon his whole
nature and relationship to externals as is fairly comparable
to a death.</p>

<p>The same illustration is frequent in ordinary
speech. What do we mean when we talk of an old
man being dead to youthful passions or follies or
ambitions? We mean that they have ceased to
interest him, that he is <i>separated</i> from them and
<i>insensible</i> to them. Death is the separator. What
an awful gulf there is between that fixed white face
beneath the sheet, and all the things about which the
man was so eager an hour ago! How impossible
for any cries of love to pass the chasm! &ldquo;His
sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;business&rdquo; which filled his thoughts, crumbles to
pieces, and he cares not. Nothing reaches him or
interests him any more. So, if we have got hold of
Christ as our Saviour, and have found in His cross
the anchor of souls, that experience will deaden us
to all which was our life, and the measure in which
we are joined to Jesus by our faith in His great
sacrifice, will be the measure in which we are
detached from our former selves, and from old
objects of interest and pursuit. The change may
either be called dying with Christ, or rising with
Him. The one phrase takes hold of it at an earlier
stage than the other; the one puts stress on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
ceasing to be what we were, the other on our
beginning to be what we were not. So our text is
followed by a paragraph corresponding in form and
substance, and beginning, &ldquo;If ye then be risen with
Christ,&rdquo; as this begins, &ldquo;If ye died with Christ!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such detachment from externals and separation
from a former self is not unknown in ordinary life.
Strong emotion of any kind makes us insensible to
things around, and even to physical pain. Many a
man with the excitement of the battle-field boiling
in his brain, &ldquo;receives but recks not of a wound.&rdquo;
Absorption of thought and interest leads to what is
called &ldquo;absence of mind,&rdquo; where the surroundings
are entirely unfelt, as in the case of the saint who
rode all day on the banks of the Swiss lake, plunged
in theological converse, and at evening asked where
the lake was, though its waves had been rippling for
twenty miles at his mule&#8217;s feet. Higher tastes drive
out lower ones, as some great stream turned into a
new channel will sweep it clear of mud and rubbish.
So, if we are joined to Christ, He will fill our souls
with strong emotions and interests which will deaden
our sensitiveness to things around us, and will inspire
new loves, tastes and desires, which will make us
indifferent to much that we used to be eager about
and hostile to much that we once cherished.</p>

<p>To what shall we die if we are Christians? The
Apostle answers that question in various ways,
which we may profitably group together. &ldquo;Reckon
ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto <i>sin</i>&rdquo;
(Rom. vi. 11). &ldquo;He died for all, that they which
live should no longer live unto <i>themselves</i>&rdquo; (2 Cor.
v. 14, 15). &ldquo;Ye are become dead to the <i>law</i>&rdquo;
(Rom. vii. 6). By the cross of Christ, &ldquo;the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
hath been crucified unto me, and I unto <i>the world</i>.&rdquo;
So then, to the whole mass of outward material
things, all this present order which surrounds us, to
the unrenounced self which has ruled us so long,
and to the sin which results from the appeals of
outward things to that evil self&mdash;to these, and to
the mere outward letter of a commandment which is
impotent to enforce its own behests or deliver self
from the snares of the world and the burden of sin,
we cease to belong in the measure in which we are
Christ&#8217;s. The separation is not complete; but, if
we are Christians at all, it is begun, and henceforward
our life is to be a &ldquo;dying daily.&rdquo; It must
either be a dying life or a living death. We shall
still belong in our outward being&mdash;and, alas! far
too much in heart also&mdash;to the world and self and
sin&mdash;but, if we are Christians at all, there will be a
real separation from these in the inmost heart of our
hearts, and the germ of entire deliverance from them
all will be in us.</p>

<p>This day needs that truth to be strongly urged.
The whole meaning of the death of Christ is not
reached when it is regarded as the great propitiation
for our sins. Is it the pattern for our lives? has it
drawn us away from our love of the world, from our
sinful self, from the temptations to sin, from cowering
before duties which we hate but dare not neglect?
has it changed the current of our lives, and lifted us
into a new region where we find new interests, loves
and aims, before which the twinkling lights, which
once were stars to us, pale their ineffectual fires?
If so, then, just in as much as it is so, and not
one hair&#8217;s breadth the more, may we call ourselves
Christians. If not, it is of no use for us to talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
about looking to the cross as the source of our
salvation. Such a look, if it be true and genuine,
will certainly change all a man&#8217;s tastes, habits,
aspirations, and relationships. If we know nothing
of dying with Christ, it is to be feared we know as
little of Christ&#8217;s dying for us.</p>

<p>This great fact of the Christian&#8217;s death with
Christ comes into view here mainly as pointing the
contradiction between the Christian&#8217;s position, and
his subjection to the prescriptions and prohibitions of
a religion which consists chiefly in petty rules about
conduct. We are &ldquo;dead&rdquo; says Paul, &ldquo;to the rudiments
of the world,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which we have
already heard in verse 8 of this chapter, where we
found its meaning to be &ldquo;precepts of an elementary
character, fit for babes, not for men in Christ, and
moving principally in the region of the material.&rdquo;
It implies a condemnation of all such regulation
religion on the two grounds, that it is an anachronism,
seeking to perpetuate an earlier stage which has been
left behind, and that it has to do with the outsides of
things, with the material and visible only. To such
rudiments we are dead with Christ. Then, queries
Paul, with irresistible triumphant question&mdash;why, in
the name of consistency, &ldquo;do you subject yourself
to ordinances&rdquo; (of which we have already heard in
verse 14 of the chapter) such as &ldquo;handle not, nor
taste, nor touch?&rdquo; These three prohibitions are
not Paul&#8217;s, but are quoted by him as specimens of
the kind of rules and regulations which he is protesting
against. The ascetic teachers kept on
vehemently reiterating their prohibitions, and as the
correct rendering of the words shows, with a
constantly increasing intolerance. &ldquo;Handle not&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
is a less rigid prohibition than &ldquo;touch not.&rdquo; The
first says, Do not lay hold of; the last Do not even
touch with the tip of your finger. So asceticism,
like many another tendency and habit, grows by
indulgence, and demands abstinence ever more rigid
and separation ever more complete. And the whole
thing is out of date, and a misapprehension of the
genius of Christianity. Man&#8217;s work in religion is
ever to confine it to the surface, to throw it
outward and make it a mere round of things done
and things abstained from. Christ&#8217;s work in religion
is to drive it inwards, and to focus all its energy on
&ldquo;the hidden man of the heart,&rdquo; knowing that if that
be right, the visible will come right. It is waste
labour to try to stick figs on the prickles of a thorn
bush&mdash;as is the tree, so will be the fruit. There are
plenty of pedants and martinets in religion as well
as on the parade ground. There must be so many
buttons on the uniform, and the shoulder belts must
be pipe-clayed, and the rifles on the shoulders
sloped at just such an angle&mdash;and then all will be
right. Perhaps so. Disciplined courage is better
than courage undisciplined. But there is much
danger of all the attention being given to drill, and
then, when the parade ground is exchanged for the
battle-field, disaster comes because there is plenty of
etiquette and no dash. Men&#8217;s lives are pestered out
of them by a religion which tries to tie them down
with as many tiny threads as those with which the
Liliputians fastened down Gulliver. But Christianity
in its true and highest forms is not a religion of
prescriptions but of principles. It does not keep
perpetually dinning a set of petty commandments
and prohibitions into our ears. Its language is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a continual &ldquo;Do this, forbear from that,&rdquo;&mdash;but
&ldquo;Love, and thou fulfillest the law.&rdquo; It works from
the centre outwards to the circumference; first
making clean the inside of the platter, and so
ensuring that the outside shall be clean also. The
error with which Paul fought, and which perpetually
crops up anew, having its roots deep in human
nature, begins with the circumference and wastes
effort in burnishing the outside.</p>

<p>The parenthesis which follows in the text, &ldquo;all
which things are to perish with the using,&rdquo; contains
an incidental remark intended to show the mistake
of attaching such importance to regulations about
diet and the like, from the consideration of the
perishableness of these meats and drinks about which
so much was said by the false teachers. &ldquo;They
are all destined for corruption, for physical decomposition&mdash;in
the very act of consumption.&rdquo; You
cannot use them without using them up. They are
destroyed in the very moment of being used. Is it
fitting for men who have died with Christ to this
fleeting world, to make so much of its perishable
things?</p>

<p>May we not widen this thought beyond its specific
application here, and say that death with Christ to
the world should deliver us from the temptation of
making much of the things which perish with the
using, whether that temptation is presented in the
form of attaching exaggerated religious importance
to ascetic abstinence from them or in that of
exaggerated regard and unbridled use of them?
Asceticism and Sybaritic luxury have in common
an over-estimate of the importance of the material
things. The one is the other turned inside out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Dives in his purple and fine linen, and the ascetic
in his hair shirt, both make too much of &ldquo;what they
shall put on.&rdquo; The one with his feasts and the
other with his fasts both think too much of what
they shall eat and drink. A man who lives on high
with his Lord puts all these things in their right
place. There are things which do <i>not</i> perish with
the using, but grow with use, like the five loaves in
Christ&#8217;s hands. Truth, love, holiness, all Christlike
graces and virtues increase with exercise, and the
more we feed on the bread which comes down from
heaven, the more shall we have for our own nourishment
and for our brother&#8217;s need. There is a treasure
which faileth not, bags which wax not old, the
durable riches and undecaying possessions of the
soul that lives on Christ and grows like Him.
These let us seek after; for if our religion be worth
anything at all, it should carry us past all the
fleeting wealth of earth straight into the heart of
things, and give us for our portion that God whom
we can never exhaust, nor outgrow, but possess the
more as we use His sweetness for the solace, and
His all-sufficient Being for the good, of our souls.</p>

<p>The final inconsistency between the Christian
position and the practical errors in question is
glanced at in the words &ldquo;after the commandments
and doctrines of men,&rdquo; which refer, of course, to
the ordinances of which Paul is speaking. The
expression is a quotation from Isaiah&#8217;s (xxix. 13)
denunciation of the Pharisees of his day, and as
used here seems to suggest that our Lord&#8217;s great
discourse on the worthlessness of the Jewish
punctilios about meats and drinks was in the
Apostle&#8217;s mind, since the same words of Isaiah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
occur there in a similar connection. It is not fitting
that we, who are withdrawn from dependence on the
outward visible order of things by our union with
Christ in His death, should be under the authority
of men. Here is the true democracy of the Christian
society. &ldquo;Ye were redeemed with a price. Be not
the servants of men.&rdquo; Our union to Jesus Christ is
a union of absolute authority and utter submission.
We all have access to the one source of illumination,
and we are bound to take our orders from the one
Master. The protest against the imposition of human
authority on the Christian soul is made not in the
interests of self-will, but from reverence to the only
voice that has the right to give autocratic commands
and to receive unquestioning obedience. We are
free in proportion as we are dead to the world with
Christ. We are free from men not that we may
please ourselves, but that we may please Him.
&ldquo;Hold your peace, I want to hear what my Master
has to command me,&rdquo; is the language of the Christian
freedman, who is free that he may serve, and because
he serves.</p>

<p>II. We have to consider one great purpose of all
teaching and external worship, by its power in
attaining which any system is to be tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in
will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body,
<i>but are</i> not of any value against the indulgence of
the flesh.&rdquo; Here is the conclusion of the whole
matter, the parting summary of the indictment
against the whole irritating tangle of restrictions and
prescriptions. From a moral point of view it is
worthless, as having no coercive power over &ldquo;the
flesh.&rdquo; Therein lies its conclusive condemnation, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
if religious observances do not help a man to subdue
his sinful self, what, in the name of common sense,
is the use of them?</p>

<p>The Apostle knows very well that the system
which he was opposing had much which commended
it to people, especially to those who did not look
very deep. It had a &ldquo;show of wisdom&rdquo; very fascinating
on a superficial glance, and that in three points,
all of which caught the vulgar eye, and all of which
turned into the opposite on closer examination.</p>

<p>It has the look of being exceeding devotion and
zealous worship. These teachers with their abundant
forms impose upon the popular imagination, as if
they were altogether given up to devout contemplation
and prayer. But if one looks a little more
closely at them, one sees that their devotion is the
indulgence of their own will and not surrender to
God&#8217;s. They are not worshipping Him as He has
appointed, but as they have themselves chosen, and
as they are rendering services which He has not
required, they are in a very true sense worshipping
their own wills, and not God at all. By &ldquo;will-worship&rdquo;
seems to be meant self-imposed forms of
religious service which are the outcome not of
obedience, nor of the instincts of a devout heart, but
of a man&#8217;s own will. And the Apostle implies that
such supererogatory and volunteered worship is no
worship. Whether offered in a cathedral or a barn,
whether the worshipper wear a cope or a fustian
jacket, such service is not accepted. A prayer which
is but the expression of the worshipper&#8217;s own will,
instead of being &ldquo;not my will but Thine be done,&rdquo;
reaches no higher than the lips that utter it. If we
are subtly and half unconsciously obeying self even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
while we seem to be bowing before God; if we are
seeming to pray, and are all the while burning
incense to ourselves, instead of being drawn out of
ourselves by the beauty and the glory of the God
towards whom our spirits yearn, then our devotion is
a mask, and our prayers will be dispersed in empty air.</p>

<p>The deceptive appearance of wisdom in these
teachers and their doctrines is further manifest in
the humility which felt so profoundly the gulf
between man and God that it was fain to fill the
void with its fantastic creations of angel mediators.
Humility is a good thing, and it looked very humble
to say, We cannot suppose that such insignificant
flesh-encompassed creatures as we can come into
contact and fellowship with God; but it was a great
deal more humble to take God at His word, and to
let Him lay down the possibilities and conditions
of intercourse, and to tread the way of approach to
Him which He has appointed. If a great king were
to say to all the beggars and ragged losels of his
capital, Come to the palace to-morrow; which would
be the humbler, he who went, rags and leprosy and
all, or he who hung back because he was so keenly
conscious of his squalor? God says to men, &ldquo;Come
to My arms through My Son. Never mind the dirt,
come.&rdquo; Which is the humbler: he who takes God
at His word, and runs to hide his face on his Father&#8217;s
breast, having access to Him through Christ the
Way, or he who will not venture near till he has
found some other mediators besides Christ? A
humility so profound that it cannot think God&#8217;s
promise and Christ&#8217;s mediation enough for it, has
gone so far West that it has reached the East, and
from humility has become pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Further, this system has a show of wisdom in
&ldquo;severity to the body.&rdquo; Any asceticism is a great
deal more to men&#8217;s taste than abandoning self.
They will rather stick hooks in their backs and do
the &ldquo;swinging poojah,&rdquo; than give up their sins or
yield up their wills. It is easier to travel the whole
distance from Cape Comorin to the shrine of Juggernaut,
measuring every foot of it by the body laid
prostrate in the dust, than to surrender the heart to
the love of God. In the same manner the milder
forms of putting oneself to pain, hair shirts, scourgings,
abstinence from pleasant things with the notion
that thereby merit is acquired, or sin atoned for,
have a deep root in human nature, and hence &ldquo;a
show of wisdom.&rdquo; It is strange, and yet not strange,
that people should think that, somehow or other,
they recommend themselves to God by making
themselves uncomfortable, but so it is that religion
presents itself to many minds mainly as a system of
restrictions and injunctions which forbids the agreeable
and commands the unpleasant. So does our
poor human nature vulgarise and travesty Christ&#8217;s
solemn command to deny ourselves and take up our
cross after Him.</p>

<p>The conclusive condemnation of all the crowd
of punctilious restrictions of which the Apostle has
been speaking lies in the fact that, however they
may correspond to men&#8217;s mistaken notions, and so
seem to be the dictate of wisdom, they &ldquo;are not of
any value against the indulgence of the flesh.&rdquo; This
is one great end of all moral and spiritual discipline,
and if practical regulations do not tend to secure it,
they are worthless.</p>

<p>Of course by &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; here we are to understand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
as usually in the Pauline Epistles, not merely the
body but the whole unregenerate personality, the
entire unrenewed self that thinks and feels and wills
and desires apart from God. To indulge and satisfy
it is to die, to slay and suppress it is to live. All
these &ldquo;ordinances&rdquo; with which the heretical teachers
were pestering the Colossians, have no power, Paul
thinks, to keep that self down, and therefore they
seem to him so much rubbish. He thus lifts the
whole question up to a higher level and implies a
standard for judging much formal outward Christianity
which would make very short work of it.</p>

<p>A man may be keeping the whole round of them
and seven devils may be in his heart. They distinctly
tend to foster some of the &ldquo;works of the
flesh,&rdquo; such as self-righteousness, uncharitableness,
censoriousness, and they as distinctly altogether fail
to subdue any of them. A man may stand on a
pillar like Simeon Stylites for years, and be none
the better. Historically, the ascetic tendency has
not been associated with the highest types of real
saintliness except by accident, and has never been
their productive cause. The bones rot as surely
inside the sepulchre though the whitewash on its
dome be ever so thick.</p>

<p>So the world and the flesh are very willing that
Christianity should shrivel into a religion of prohibitions
and ceremonials, because all manner of
vices and meannesses may thrive and breed under
these, like scorpions under stones. There is only
one thing that will put the collar on the neck of
the animal within us, and that is the power of the
indwelling Christ. The evil that is in us all is too
strong for every other fetter. Its cry to all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
&ldquo;commandments and ordinances of men&rdquo; is, &ldquo;Jesus
I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?&rdquo; Not
in obedience to such, but in the reception into our
spirits of His own life, is our power of victory over
self. &ldquo;This I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall
not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="ColXVII" id="ColXVII"></a>XVII.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE PRESENT CHRISTIAN LIFE, A RISEN LIFE.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that
are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the
earth. For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When
Christ, <i>Who is</i> our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with Him
be manifested in glory.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iii. 1&ndash;4 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We have now done with controversy. We
hear no more about heretical teachers. The
Apostle has cut his way through the tangled
thickets of error, and has said his say as to the
positive truths with which he would hew them down.
For the remainder of the letter, we have principally
plain practical exhortations, and a number of interesting
personal details.</p>

<p>The paragraph which we have now to consider is
the transition from the controversial to the ethical
portion of the Epistle. It touches the former by its
first words, &ldquo;If ye then were raised together with
Christ,&rdquo; which correspond in form and refer in
meaning to the beginning of the previous paragraph,
&ldquo;If ye died with Christ.&rdquo; It touches the latter
because it embodies the broad general precept,
&ldquo;Seek the things that are above,&rdquo; of which the
following practical directions are but varying applications
in different spheres of duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
In considering these words we must begin by
endeavouring to put clearly their connection and
substance. As they flew from Paul&#8217;s eager lips,
motive and precept, symbol and fact, the present
and future are blended together. It may conduce
to clearness if we try to part these elements.</p>

<p>There are here two similar exhortations, side by
side. &ldquo;Seek the things that are above,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Set
your mind on the things that are above.&rdquo; The
first is <i>preceded</i>, and the second is <i>followed</i> by its
reason. So the two laws of conduct are, as it were,
enclosed like a kernel in its shell, or a jewel in
a gold setting, by encompassing motives. These
considerations, in which the commandment are imbedded,
are the double thought of union with
Christ in His resurrection, and in His death, and
as consequent thereon, participation in His present
hidden life, and in His future glorious manifestation.
So we have here the present budding life of the
Christian in union with the risen, hidden Christ; the
future consummate flower of the Christian life in
union with the glorious manifested Christ; and the
practical aim and direction which alone is consistent
with either bud or flower.</p>

<p>I. The present budding life of the Christian in
union with the risen, hidden Christ.</p>

<p>Two aspects of this life are set forth in verses 1
and 3&mdash;&ldquo;raised with Christ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ye died, and
your life is hid with Christ.&rdquo; A still profounder
thought lies in the words of verse 4, &ldquo;Christ <i>is</i> our
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have seen in former parts of this Epistle that
Paul believed that, when a man puts His faith in
Jesus Christ, he is joined to Him in such a way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that he is separated from his former self and dead
to the world. That great change may be considered
either with reference to what the man has ceased
to be, or with reference to what he becomes. In
the one aspect, it is a death; in the other, it is
a resurrection. It depends on the point of view
whether a semicircle seems convex or concave. The
two thoughts express substantially the same fact.
That great change was brought about in these
Colossian Christians, at a definite time, as the
language shows; and by a definite means&mdash;namely,
by union with Christ through faith, which grasps
His death and resurrection as at once the ground of
salvation, the pattern for life, and the prophecy of
glory. So then, the great truths here are these; the
impartation of life by union with Christ, which life
is truly a resurrection life, and is, moreover, hidden
with Christ in God.</p>

<p>Union with Christ by faith is the condition of a
real communication of life. &ldquo;In Him was life,&rdquo; says
John&#8217;s Gospel, meaning thereby to assert, in the
language of our Epistle, that &ldquo;in Him were all
things created, and in Him all things consist.&rdquo; Life
in all its forms is dependent on union in varying
manner with the Divine, and upheld only by His
continual energy. The creature must touch God or
perish. Of that energy the Uncreated Word of God
is the channel&mdash;&ldquo;with Thee is the fountain of life.&rdquo;
As the life of the body, so the higher self-conscious
life of the thinking, feeling, striving soul, is also fed
and kept alight by the perpetual operation of a
higher Divine energy, imparted in like manner by
the Divine Word. Therefore, with deep truth, the
psalm just quoted, goes on to say, &ldquo;In Thy light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
shall we see light&rdquo;&mdash;and therefore, too, John&#8217;s Gospel
continues: &ldquo;And the life was the light of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there is a still higher plane on which life may
be manifested, and nobler energies which may accompany
it. The body may live, and mind and heart
be dead. Therefore Scripture speaks of a threefold
life: that of the animal nature, that of the intellectual
and emotional nature, and that of the spirit, which
lives when it is conscious of God, and touches Him
by aspiration, hope, and love. This is the loftiest
life. Without it, a man is dead while he lives. With
it, he lives though he dies. And like the others, it
depends on union with the Divine life as it is stored
in Jesus Christ&mdash;but in this case, the union is a
conscious union by faith. If I trust to Him, and
am thereby holding firmly by Him, my union with
Him is so real, that, in the measure of my faith, His
fulness passes over into my emptiness, His righteousness
into my sinfulness, His life into my death, as
surely as the electric shock thrills my nerves when I
grasp the poles of the battery.</p>

<p>No man can breathe into another&#8217;s nostrils the
breath of life. But Christ can and does breathe
His life into us; and this true miracle of a communication
of spiritual life takes place in every man
who humbly trusts himself to Him. So the question
comes home to each of us&mdash;am I living by my
union with Christ? do I draw from Him that better
being which He is longing to pour into my withered,
dead spirit? It is not enough to live the animal life;
the more it is fed, the more are the higher lives
starved and dwindled. It is not enough to live the life
of intellect and feeling. That may be in brightest,
keenest exercise, and yet we&mdash;our best selves&mdash;may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
be dead&mdash;separated from God in Christ, and therefore
dead&mdash;and all our activity may be but as a
galvanic twitching of the muscles in a corpse. Is
Christ our life, its source, its strength, its aim, its
motive? Do we live in Him, by Him, with Him,
for Him? If not, we are dead while we live.</p>

<p>This life from Christ is a resurrection life. &ldquo;The
power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection&rdquo; is threefold&mdash;as a
seal of His mission and Messiahship, &ldquo;declared to
be the Son of God, by His resurrection from the
dead;&rdquo; as a prophecy and pledge of ours, &ldquo;now
is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits
of them that slept;&rdquo; and as a symbol and
pattern of our new life of Christian consecration,
&ldquo;likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be indeed
dead unto sin.&rdquo; This last use of the resurrection of
Christ is a plain witness of the firm, universal and
uncontested belief in the historical fact, throughout
the Churches which Paul addressed. The fact must
have been long familiar and known as undoubted,
before it could have been thus moulded into a
symbol. But, passing from that, consider that our
union to Christ produces a moral and spiritual change
analogous to His resurrection. After all, it is the
moral and not the mystical side which is the main
thing in Paul&#8217;s use of this thought. He would
insist, that all true Christianity operates a death to
the old self, to sin and to the whole present order
of things, and endows a man with new tastes, desires
and capacities, like a resurrection to a new being.
These heathen converts&mdash;picked from the filthy cesspools
in which many of them had been living, and set
on a pure path, with the astounding light of a Divine
love flooding it, and a bright hope painted on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
infinite blackness ahead&mdash;had surely passed into a
new life. Many a man in this day, long familiar
with Christian teaching, has found himself made
over again in mature life, when his heart has grasped
Christ. Drunkards, profligates, outcasts, have found
it life from the dead; and even where there has not
been such complete visible revolution as in them,
there has been such deep-seated central alteration
that it is no exaggeration to call it resurrection.
The plain fact is that real Christianity in a man
will produce in him a radical moral change. If our
religion does not do that in us, it is nothing. Ceremonial
and doctrine are but means to an end&mdash;making
us better men. The highest purpose of
Christ&#8217;s work, for which He both &ldquo;died and rose
and revived,&rdquo; is to change us into the likeness of
His own beauty of perfect purity. That risen life
is no mere exaggeration of mystical rhetoric, but an
imperative demand of the highest morality, and the
plain issue of it is: &ldquo;Let not sin therefore reign in
your mortal body.&rdquo; Do I say that I am a Christian?
The test by which my claim must be tried is the
likeness of my life here to Him who has died unto
sin, and liveth unto God.</p>

<p>But the believing soul is risen with Christ also,
inasmuch as our union with Him makes us partakers
of His resurrection as our victory over death. The
water in the reservoir and in the fountain is the
same; the sunbeam in the chamber and in the sky
are one. The life which flows into our spirits from
Christ is a life that has conquered death, and makes
us victors in that last conflict, even though we have
to go down into the darkness. If Christ live in us,
we can never die. &ldquo;It is not possible that <i>we</i> should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
be holden of <i>it</i>.&rdquo; The bands which He broke can
never be fastened on our limbs. The gates of death
were so warped and the locks so spoiled when He
burst them asunder, that they can never be closed
again. There are many arguments for a future life
beyond the grave, but there is only one proof of it&mdash;the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, trusting in Him,
and with our souls bound in the bundle of life with
our Lord the King, we can cherish quiet thankfulness
of heart, and bless the God and Father of our Lord
who hath begotten us again into a lively hope by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>

<p>This risen life is a hidden life. Its roots are in
Him. He has passed in His ascension into the light
which is inaccessible, and is hidden in its blaze, bearing
with Him our life, concealed there with Him in
God. Faith stands gazing into heaven, as the
cloud, the visible manifestation from of old of the
Divine presence, hides Him from sight, and turns
away feeling that the best part of its true self is gone
with Him. So here Paul points his finger upwards
to where &ldquo;Christ is, sitting at the right hand of
God,&rdquo; and says&mdash;We are here in outward seeming,
but our true life is there, if we are His. And what
majestic, pregnant words these are! How full, and
yet how empty for a prurient curiosity, and how
reverently reticent even while they are triumphantly
confident! How gently they suggest repose&mdash;deep
and unbroken, and yet full of active energy! For
if the attitude imply rest, the locality&mdash;&ldquo;at the right
hand of God&rdquo;&mdash;expresses not only the most intimate
approach to, but also the wielding of the Divine
omnipotence. What is the right hand of God but
the activity of His power? and what less can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ascribed to Christ here, than His being enthroned
in closest union with the Father, exercising Divine
dominion, and putting forth Divine power. No
doubt the ascended and glorified bodily manhood of
Jesus Christ has a local habitation, but the old psalm
might teach us that wherever space is, even there
&ldquo;Thy right hand upholds,&rdquo; and there is our ascended
Lord, sitting as in deepest rest, but working all the
work of God. And it is just because He is at the
right hand of God that He is hid. The light hides.
He has been lost to sight in the glory.</p>

<p>He has gone in thither, bearing with Him the
true source and root of our lives into the secret place
of the Most High. Therefore we no longer belong
to this visible order of things in the midst of which
we tarry for a while. The true spring that feeds
our lives lies deep beneath all the surface waters.
These may dry up, but it will flow. These may be
muddied with rain, but it will be limpid as ever.
The things seen do not go deep enough to touch
our real life. They are but as the winds that fret,
and the currents that sway the surface and shallower
levels of the ocean, while the great depths are still.
The circumference is all a whirl; the centre is at rest.</p>

<p>Nor need we leave out of sight, though it be not
the main thought here, that the Christian life is
hidden, inasmuch as here on earth action ever falls
short of thought, and the love and faith by which a
good man lives can never be fully revealed in his
conduct and character. You cannot carry electricity
from the generator to the point where it is to work
without losing two-thirds of it by the way. Neither
word nor deed can adequately set forth a soul; and
the profounder and nobler the emotion, the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
inadequate are the narrow gates of tongue and hand
to give it passage. The deepest love can often only
&ldquo;love and be silent.&rdquo; So, while every man is truly
a mystery to his neighbour, a life which is rooted in
Christ is more mysterious to the ordinary eye than
any other. It is fed by hidden manna. It is replenished
from a hidden source. It is guided by
other than the world&#8217;s motives, and follows unseen
aims. &ldquo;Therefore the world knoweth us not, because
it knew Him not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. We have the future consummate flower of the
Christian life in union with the manifested, glorious
Christ.</p>

<p>The future personal manifestation of Jesus Christ
in visible glory is, in the teaching of all the New
Testament writers, the last stage in the series of His
Divine human conditions. As surely as the Incarnation
led to the cross, and the cross to the empty
grave, and the empty grave to the throne, so surely
does the throne lead to the coming again in glory.
And as with Christ, so with His servants, the
manifestation in glory is the certain end of all the
preceding, as surely as the flower is of the tiny green
leaves that peep above the frost-bound earth in
bleak March days. Nothing in that future, however
glorious and wonderful, but has its germ and vital
beginning in our union with Christ here by humble
faith. The great hopes which we may cherish are
gathered up here into these words&mdash;&ldquo;shall be
manifested with Him.&rdquo; That is far more than was
conveyed by the old translation&mdash;&ldquo;shall appear.&rdquo;
The roots of our being shall be disclosed, for He
shall come, &ldquo;and every eye shall see Him.&rdquo; We
shall be seen for what we are. The outward life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
shall correspond to the inward. The faith and love
which often struggled in vain for expression and
were thwarted by the obstinate flesh, as a sculptor
trying to embody his dream might be by a block of
marble with many a flaw and speck, shall then be
able to reveal themselves completely. Whatever is
in the heart shall be fully visible in the life. Stammering
words and imperfect deeds shall vex us no
more. &ldquo;His name shall be in their foreheads&rdquo;&mdash;no
longer only written in fleshly tables of the heart and
partially visible in the character, but stamped legibly
and completely on life and nature. They shall
walk in the light, and so shall be seen of all. Here
the truest followers of Christ shine like an intermittent
star, seen through mist and driving cloud:
&ldquo;Then shall the righteous <i>blaze forth</i> like the sun
in the kingdom of My Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this is not all. The manifestation is to be
&ldquo;with Him.&rdquo; The union which was here effected
by faith, and marred by many an interposing obstacle
of sin and selfishness, of flesh and sense, is to be
perfected then. No film of separation is any more
to break its completeness. Here we often lose our
hold of Him amidst the distractions of work, even
when done for His sake; and our life is at best but
an imperfect compromise between contemplation and
action; but then, according to that great saying,
&ldquo;His servants shall serve Him, and see His face,&rdquo;
the utmost activity of consecrated service, though it be
far more intense and on a nobler scale than anything
here, will not interfere with the fixed gaze on His
countenance. We shall serve like Martha, and yet
never remove from sitting with Mary, rapt and
blessed at His feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
This is the one thought of that solemn future
worth cherishing. Other hopes may feed sentiment,
and be precious sometimes to aching hearts. A
reverent longing or an irreverent curiosity, may seek to
discern something more in the far-off light. But it
is enough for the heart to know that &ldquo;we shall ever
be with the Lord;&rdquo; and the more we have that one
hope in its solitary grandeur, the better. We shall
be with Him in &ldquo;in glory.&rdquo; That is the climax of
all that Paul would have us hope. &ldquo;Glory&rdquo; is the
splendour and light of the self-revealing God. In the
heart of the blaze stands Christ; the bright cloud
enwraps Him, as it did on the mountain of transfiguration,
and into the dazzling radiance His
disciples will pass as His companions did then, nor
&ldquo;fear as they enter into the cloud.&rdquo; They walk
unshrinking in that beneficent fire, because with them
is one like unto a Son of man, through whom they
dwell, as in their own calm home, amidst &ldquo;the everlasting
burning,&rdquo; which shall not destroy them, but
kindle them into the likeness of its own flashing
glory.</p>

<p>Then shall the life which here was but in bud,
often unkindly nipt and struggling, burst into the
consummate beauty of the perfect flower &ldquo;which
fadeth not away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. We have the practical aim and direction
which alone is consistent with either stage of the
Christian life.</p>

<p>Two injunctions are based upon these considerations&mdash;&ldquo;seek,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;set your mind upon,&rdquo; the
things that are above. The one points to the outward
life of effort and aim; the other to the inward
life of thought and longing. Let the things above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
then, be the constant mark at which you aim. There
is a vast realm of real existence of which your risen
Lord is the centre and the life. Make it the point
to which you strive. That will not lead to despising
earth and nearer objects. These, so far as they are
really good and worthy, stand right in the line of
direction which our efforts will take if we are seeking
the things that are above, and may all be stages
on our journey Christwards. The lower objects are
best secured by those who live for the higher. No
man is so well able to do the smallest duties here,
or to bear the passing troubles of this world of
illusion and change, or to wring the last drop of
sweetness out of swiftly fleeting joys, as he to whom
everything on earth is dwarfed by the eternity
beyond, as some hut beside a palace, and is great
because it is like a little window a foot square
through which infinite depths of sky with all their
stars shine in upon him. The true meaning and
greatness of the present is that it is the vestibule of
the august future. The staircase leading to the
presence chamber of the king may be of poor deal,
narrow, crooked, and stowed away in a dark turret,
but it has dignity by reason of that to which it gives
access. So let our aims pass through the earthly
and find in them helps to the things that are above.
We should not fire all our bullets at the short range.
Seek ye first the kingdom of God&mdash;the things which
are above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set your mind on&rdquo; these things, says the
Apostle further. Let them occupy mind and heart&mdash;and
this in order that we may seek them. The
direction of the aims will follow the set and current
of the thoughts. &ldquo;As a man thinketh in his heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
so is he.&rdquo; How can we be shaping our efforts to
reach a good which we have not clearly before our
imaginations as desirable? How should the life of
so many professing Christians be other than a lame
creeping along the low levels of earth, seeing that so
seldom do they look up to &ldquo;see the King in His
beauty and the land that is very far off&rdquo;? John
Bunyan&#8217;s &ldquo;man with the muckrake&rdquo; grubbed away
so eagerly among the rubbish, because he never
lifted his eyes to the crown that hung above his
head. In many a silent, solitary hour of contemplation,
with the world shut out and Christ brought
very near, we must find the counterpoise to the
pressure of earthly aims, or our efforts after the
things that are above will be feeble and broken.
Life goes at such a pace to-day, and the present is
so exacting with most of us, that quiet meditation
is, I fear me, almost out of fashion with Christian
people. We must become more familiar with the
secret place of the most High, and more often enter
into our chambers and shut our doors about us, if in
the bustle of our busy days we are to aim truly and
strongly at the only object which saves life from
being a waste and a sin, a madness and a misery&mdash;&ldquo;the
things which are above, where Christ is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where Christ is.&rdquo; Yes, that is the only thought
which gives definiteness and solidity to that else
vague and nebulous unseen universe; the only
thought which draws our affections thither. Without
Him, there is no footing for us there. Rolling
mists of doubt and dim hopes warring with fears,
strangeness and terrors wrap it all. But if He be
there, it becomes a home for our hearts. &ldquo;I go to
prepare a place for you&rdquo;&mdash;a place where desire and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thought may walk unterrified and undoubting even
now, and where we ourselves may abide when our
time comes, nor shrink from the light nor be
oppressed by the glory.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My knowledge of that life is small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eye of faith is dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But &#8217;tis enough that Christ knows all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall be with Him.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Into that solemn world we shall all pass. We
can choose whether we shall go to it as to our
long-sought home, to find in it Him who is our life;
or whether we shall go reluctant and afraid, leaving
all for which we have cared, and going to Him
whom we have neglected and that which we have
feared. Christ will be manifested, and we shall see
Him. We can choose whether it will be to us the
joy of beholding the soul of our soul, the friend
long-loved when dimly seen from afar; or whether
it shall be the vision of a face that will stiffen us to
stone and stab us with its light. We must make
our choice. If we give our hearts to Him, and by
faith unite ourselves with Him, then, &ldquo;when He
shall appear, we shall have boldness, and not be
ashamed before Him at His coming.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="ColXVIII" id="ColXVIII"></a>XVIII.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>SLAYING SELF THE FOUNDATION PRECEPT OF
PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which
is idolatry; for which things&#8217; sake cometh the wrath of God upon the
sons of disobedience; in the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye
lived in these things. But now put ye also away all these; anger,
wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: lie not
one to another.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iii. 5&ndash;9 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Mortify <i>therefore</i>&rdquo;&mdash;wherefore? The previous
words give the reason. Because &ldquo;ye
died&rdquo; with Christ, and because ye &ldquo;were raised
together with Him.&rdquo; In other words, the plainest,
homeliest moral teaching of this Epistle, such as
that which immediately follows, is built upon its
&ldquo;mystical&rdquo; theology. Paul thinks that the deep
things which he has been saying about union with
Christ in His death and resurrection have the most
intimate connection with common life. These profound
truths have the keenest edge, and are as a
sacrificial knife, to slay the life of self. Creed is
meant to tell on conduct. Character is the last
outcome and test of doctrine. But too many people
deal with their theological beliefs as they do with
their hassocks and prayer books and hymn books
in their pews&mdash;use them for formal worship once a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
week, and leave them for the dust to settle on them
till Sunday comes round again. So it is very
necessary to put the practical inferences very plainly,
to reiterate the most commonplace and threadbare
precepts as the issue of the most recondite teaching,
and to bind the burden of duty on men&#8217;s backs with
the cords of principles and doctrines.</p>

<p>Accordingly the section of the Epistle which
deals with Christian character now begins, and this
&ldquo;therefore&rdquo; knits the two halves together. That
word protests against opposite errors. On the one
hand, some good people are to be found impatient
of exhortations to duties, and ready to say, Preach
the gospel, and the duties will spring up spontaneously
where it is received; on the other hand,
some people are to be found who see no connection
between the practice of common morality and the
belief of Christian truths, and are ready to say, Put
away your theology; it is useless lumber, the
machine will work as well without it. But Paul
believed that the firmest basis for moral teaching
and the most powerful motive for moral conduct is
&ldquo;the truth as it is in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. We have here put very plainly the paradox of
continual self-slaying as the all-embracing duty of a
Christian.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the R. V. has retained &ldquo;mortify&rdquo;
here, as that Latinized word says to an ordinary
reader much less than is meant, and hides the
allusion to the preceding contest. The marginal
alternative &ldquo;make dead&rdquo; is, to say the least, not
idiomatic English. The suggestion of the American
revisers, which is printed at the end of the R. V.,
&ldquo;put to death,&rdquo; is much better, and perhaps a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
word, such as &ldquo;slay&rdquo; or &ldquo;kill&rdquo; might have been
better still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slay your members which are upon the earth.&rdquo;
It is a vehement and paradoxical injunction, though
it be but the echo of still more solemn and stringent
words&mdash;&ldquo;pluck it out, cut it off, and cast it from
thee.&rdquo; The possibility of misunderstanding it and
bringing it down to the level of that spurious asceticism
and &ldquo;severity to the body&rdquo; against which
he has just been thundering, seems to occur to the
Apostle, and therefore he hastens to explain that he
does not mean the maiming of selves, or hacking
away limbs, but the slaying of the passions and
desires which root themselves in our bodily constitution.
The eager haste of the explanation destroys
the congruity of the sentence, but he does not
mind that. And then follows a grim catalogue of
the evil-doers on whom sentence of death is passed.</p>

<p>Before dealing with that list, two points of some
importance may be observed. The first is that the
practical exhortations of this letter begin with this
command to put off certain characteristics which are
assumed to belong to the Colossian Christians in
their natural state, and that only afterwards comes
the precept to put on (ver. 12) the fairer robes of
Christlike purity, clasped about by the girdle of
perfectness. That is to say, Paul&#8217;s anthropology
regards men as wrong and having to get right. A
great deal of the moral teaching which is outside
of Christianity, and which does not sufficiently
recognise that the first thing to be done is to cure
and alter, but talks as if men were, on the whole,
rather inclined to be good, is for that very reason
perfectly useless. Its fine precepts and lofty sentiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
go clean over people&#8217;s heads, and are
ludicrously inappropriate to the facts of the case.
The serpent has twined itself round my limbs, and
unless you can give me a knife, sharp and strong
enough to cut its loathsome coils asunder, it is cruel
to bid me walk. All men on the face of the earth
need, for moral progress, to be shown and helped
first how <i>not</i> to be what they have been, and only
after that is it of the slightest use to tell them what
they ought to be. The only thing that reaches the
universal need is a power that will make us different
from what we are. If we are to grow into goodness
and beauty, we must begin by a complete reversal
of tastes and tendencies. The thing we want first
is not progress, the going on in the direction in
which our faces are turned, but a power which can
lay a mastering hand upon our shoulders, turn us
right round, and make us go in the way opposite to
that. Culture, the development of what is in us
in germ, is not the beginning of good husbandry
on human nature as it is. The thorns have to be
stubbed up first, and the poisonous seeds sifted out,
and new soil laid down, and then culture will bring
forth something better than wild grapes. First&mdash;&ldquo;mortify;&rdquo;
then&mdash;&ldquo;put on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another point to be carefully noted is that,
according to the Apostle&#8217;s teaching, the root and
beginning of all such slaying of the evil which is
in us all, lies in our being dead with Christ to the
world. In the former chapter we found that the
Apostle&#8217;s final condemnation of the false asceticism
which was beginning to infect the Colossian Church,
was that it was of no value as a counteractive of
fleshly indulgence. But here he proclaims that what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
asceticism could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, union with Jesus Christ in His death and
risen life will do; it will subdue sin in the flesh.
That slaying here enjoined as fundamental to all
Christian holiness, is but the working out in life and
character of the revolution in the inmost self which
has been effected, if by faith we are joined to the
living Lord, who was dead and is alive for evermore.</p>

<p>There must, however, be a very vigorous act of
personal determination if the power of that union is
to be manifested in us. The act of &ldquo;slaying&rdquo; can
never be pleasant or easy. The vehemence of the
command and the form of the metaphor express the
strenuousness of the effort and the painfulness of
the process, in the same way as Paul&#8217;s other saying,
&ldquo;crucify the flesh,&rdquo; does. Suppose a man working
at some machine. His fingers get drawn between
the rollers or caught in some belting. Another
minute and he will be flattened to a shapeless bloody
mass. He catches up an axe lying by and with his
own arm hacks off his own hand at the wrist. It
takes some nerve to do that. It is not easy nor
pleasant, but it is the only alternative to a horrible
death. I know of no stimulus that will string a
man up to the analogous spiritual act here enjoined,
and enjoined by conscience also, except participation
in the death of Christ and in the resulting life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slay your members which are upon the earth&rdquo;
means tears and blood and more than blood. It
is easier far to cut off the hand, which after all is
not me, than to sacrifice passions and desires which,
though they be my worst self, are myself. It is
useless to blink the fact that the only road to holiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
is through self-suppression, self-annihilation;
and nothing can make that easy and pleasant.
True, the paths of religion are ways of pleasantness
and paths of peace, but they are steep, and climbing
is never easy. The upper air is bracing and exhilarating
indeed, but trying to lungs accustomed to the
low levels. Religion is delightsome, but self-denial
is always against the grain of the self which is
denied, and there is no religion without it. Holiness
is not to be won in a moment. It is not a matter
of consciousness, possessed when we know that
we possess it. But it has to be attained by effort.
The way to heaven is not by &ldquo;the primrose path.&rdquo;
That leads to &ldquo;the everlasting bonfire.&rdquo; For ever
it remains true that men <i>obtain</i> forgiveness and
eternal life as a gift for which the only requisite is
faith, but they <i>achieve</i> holiness, which is the permeating
of their characters with that eternal life, by
patient, believing, continuous effort. An essential
part of that effort is directed towards the conquest
and casting out of the old self in its earthward-looking
lusts and passions. The love of Jesus Christ
and the indwelling of His renewing spirit make that
conquest possible, by supplying an all-constraining
motive and an all-conquering power. But even they
do not make it easy, nor deaden the flesh to the cut
of the sacrificial knife.</p>

<p>II. We have here a grim catalogue of the condemned
to death.</p>

<p>The Apostle stands like a jailer at the prison
door, with the fatal roll in his hand, and reads out
the names of the evil doers for whom the tumbril
waits to carry them to the guillotine. It is an
ugly list but we need plain speaking that there may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
be no mistake as to the identity of the culprits.
He enumerates evils which honeycombed society
with rottenness then, and are rampant now. The
series recounts various forms of evil love, and is
so arranged as that it starts with the coarse, gross
act, and goes on to more subtle and inward forms.
It goes up the stream as it were, to the fountain
head, passing inward from deed to desire. First
stands &ldquo;fornication,&rdquo; which covers the whole ground
of immoral sexual relations, then &ldquo;all uncleanness,&rdquo;
which embraces every manifestation in word or look
or deed of the impure spirit, and so is at once wider
and subtler than the gross physical act. Then follow
&ldquo;passion&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil desire&rdquo;; the sources of the
evil deeds. These again are at once more inward
and more general than the preceding. They include
not only the lusts and longings which give rise to
the special sins just denounced, but all forms of
hungry appetite and desire after &ldquo;the things that
are upon the earth.&rdquo; If we are to try to draw a
distinction between the two, probably &ldquo;passion&rdquo; is
somewhat less wide than &ldquo;desire,&rdquo; and the former
represents the evil emotion as an affection which the
mind suffers, while the latter represents it as a longing
which it actively puts forth. The &ldquo;lusts of the
flesh&rdquo; are in the one aspect kindled by outward
temptations which come with terrible force and
carry men captive, acting almost irresistibly on the
animal nature. In the other aspect they are excited
by the voluntary action of the man himself.
In the one the evil comes into the heart; in the
other the heart goes out to the evil.</p>

<p>Then follows covetousness. The juxtaposition of
that vice with the grosser forms of sensuality is profoundly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
significant. It is closely allied with these.
It has the same root, and is but another form of evil
desire going out to the &ldquo;things which are on the
earth.&rdquo; The ordinary worldly nature flies for solace
either to the pleasures of appetite or to the passion
of acquiring. And not only are they closely connected
in root, but covetousness often follows lust in
the history of a life just as it does in this catalogue.
When the former evil spirit loses its hold, the latter
often takes its place. How many respectable
middle-aged gentlemen are now mainly devoted to
making money, whose youth was foul with sensual
indulgence? When that palled, this came to
titillate the jaded desires with a new form of gratification.
Covetousness is &ldquo;promoted <i>vice</i>, lust superannuated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reason for this warning against covetousness is
appended, &ldquo;inasmuch as (for such is the force of the
word rendered &lsquo;the which&rsquo;) it is idolatry.&rdquo; If we
say of anything, no matter what, &ldquo;If I have only
enough of this, I shall be satisfied; it is my real
aim, my sufficient good,&rdquo; that thing is a god to me,
and my real worship is paid to it, whatever may be
my nominal religion. The lowest form of idolatry
is the giving of supreme trust to a material thing,
and making that a god. There is no lower form of
fetish-worship than this, which is the real working
religion to-day of thousands of Englishmen who go
masquerading as Christians.</p>

<p>III. The exhortation is enforced by a solemn
note of warning: &ldquo;For which things&#8217; sake the wrath
of God cometh upon the children of disobedience.&rdquo;
Some authorities omit the words &ldquo;upon the children
of disobedience,&rdquo; which are supposed to have crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
in here from the parallel passage, Eph. v. 6. But
even the advocates of the omission allow that the
clause has &ldquo;preponderating support,&rdquo; and the sentence
is painfully incomplete and abrupt without
it. The R. V. has exercised a wise discretion in
retaining it.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter the Apostle included
&ldquo;warning&rdquo; in his statement of the various branches
into which his Apostolic activity was divided. His
duty seemed to him to embrace the plain stern
setting forth of that terrible reality, the wrath of
God. Here we have it urged as a reason for
shaking off these evil habits.</p>

<p>That thought of wrath as an element in the
Divine nature has become very unwelcome to this
generation. The great revelation of God in Jesus
Christ has taught the world His love, as it never
knew it before, and knows it now by no other
means. So profoundly has that truth that God is
love penetrated the consciousness of the European
world, that many people will not hear of the wrath
of God because they think it inconsistent with His
love&mdash;and sometimes reject the very gospel to which
they owe their lofty conceptions of the Divine heart,
because it speaks solemn words about His anger and
its issues.</p>

<p>But surely these two thoughts of God&#8217;s love and
God&#8217;s wrath are not inconsistent, for His wrath is
His love, pained, wounded, thrown back upon itself,
rejected and compelled to assume the form of
aversion and to do its &ldquo;strange work&rdquo;&mdash;that which
is not its natural operation&mdash;of punishment. When
we ascribe wrath to God, we must take care of
lowering the conception of it to the level of human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
wrath, which is shaken with passion and often tinged
with malice, whereas in that affection of the Divine
nature which corresponds to anger in us, there is
neither passion nor wish to harm. Nor does it
exclude the co-existence of love, as Paul witnesses in
his Epistle to the Ephesians, in one verse declaring
that &ldquo;we were the children of wrath,&rdquo; and in the
next that God &ldquo;loved us with a great love even when
we were dead in sins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God would not be a holy God if it were all the
same to Him whether a man were good or bad.
As a matter of fact, the modern revulsion against
the representation of the wrath of God is usually
accompanied with weakened conceptions of His
holiness, and of His moral government of the world.
Instead of exalting, it degrades His love to free it
from the admixture of wrath, which is like alloy
with gold, giving firmness to what were else too soft
for use. Such a God is not love, but impotent
good nature. If there be no wrath, there is no love;
if there were no love, there would be no wrath. It
is more blessed and hopeful for sinful men to
believe in a God who is angry with the wicked,
whom yet He loves, every day, and who cannot look
upon sin, than in one who does not love righteousness
enough to hate iniquity, and from whose too
indulgent hand the rod has dropped, to the spoiling
of His children. &ldquo;With the froward Thou wilt show
Thyself froward.&rdquo; The mists of our sins intercept
the gracious beams and turn the blessed sun into a
ball of fire.</p>

<p>The wrath &ldquo;<i>cometh</i>.&rdquo; That majestic present
tense may express either the continuous present
incidence of the wrath as exemplified in the moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
government of the world, in which, notwithstanding
anomalies, such sins as have been enumerated drag
after themselves their own punishment and are
&ldquo;avenged in kind,&rdquo; or it may be the present tense
expressive of prophetic certainty, which is so sure of
what shall come, that it speaks of it as already on
its road. It is eminently true of those sins of lust
and passion, that the men who do them reap as
they have sown. How many young men come up
into our great cities, innocent and strong, with a
mother&#8217;s kiss upon their lips, and a father&#8217;s blessing
hovering over their heads! They fall among bad
companions in college or warehouse, and after a
little while they disappear. Broken in health,
tainted in body and soul, they crawl home to break
their mothers&#8217; hearts&mdash;and to die. &ldquo;His bones are
full of the sins of his youth, which shall lie down
with him in the dust.&rdquo; Whether in such extreme
forms or no, that wrath comes even now, in plain
and bitter consequences on men, and still more on
women who sin in such ways.</p>

<p>And the present retribution may well be taken as
the herald and prophet of a still more solemn manifestation
of the Divine displeasure, which is already
as it were on the road, has set out from the throne
of God, and will certainly arrive here one day.
These consequences of sin already realised serve to
show the set and drift of things, and to suggest
what will happen when retribution and the harvest
of our present life of sowing come. The first fiery
drops that fell on Lot&#8217;s path as he fled from Sodom
were not more surely precursors of an overwhelming
rain, nor bade him flee for his life more urgently,
than the present punishment of sin proclaims its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sorer future punishment, and exhorts us all to come
out of the storm into the refuge, even Jesus, who
is ever even now &ldquo;delivering us from the wrath
which is&rdquo; ever even now &ldquo;coming&rdquo; on the sons of
disobedience.</p>

<p>IV. A further motive enforcing the main precept
of self-slaying is the remembrance of a sinful past,
which remembrance is at once penitent and grateful.
&ldquo;In the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye
lived in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is the difference between &ldquo;walking&rdquo; and
&ldquo;living&rdquo; in these things? The two phrases seem
synonymous, and might often be used indifferently;
but here there is evidently a well marked diversity
of meaning. The former is an expression frequent
in the Pauline Epistles as well as in John&#8217;s; as for
instance, &ldquo;to walk in love&rdquo; or &ldquo;in truth.&rdquo; That in
which men walk is conceived of as an atmosphere
encompassing them; or, without a metaphor, to walk
in anything is to have the active life or conduct
guided or occupied by it. These Colossian Christians,
then, had in the past trodden that evil path, or their
active life had been spent in that poisonous atmosphere&mdash;which
is equivalent to saying that they had
committed these sins. At what time? &ldquo;When you
lived in them.&rdquo; That does not mean merely &ldquo;when
your natural life was passed among them.&rdquo; That
would be a trivial thing to say, and it would imply
that their outward life now was not so passed, which
would not be true. In that sense they still lived in
the poisonous atmosphere. In such an age of unnameable
moral corruption no man could live out
of the foul stench which filled his nostrils whenever
he walked abroad or opened his window. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Apostle has just said that they were now &ldquo;living in
Christ,&rdquo; and their lives &ldquo;hid with Him in God.&rdquo; So
this phrase describes the condition which is the
opposite of their present, and may be paraphrased,
&ldquo;When the roots of your life, tastes, affections,
thoughts, desires were immersed, as in some feculent
bog, in these and kindred evils.&rdquo; And the meaning
of the whole is substantially&mdash;Your active life was
occupied and guided by these sins in that past time
when your inward being was knit to and nourished
by them. Or to put it plainly, conduct followed and
was shaped by inclinations and desires.</p>

<p>This retrospect enforces the main exhortation. It
is meant to awaken penitence, and the thought that
time enough has been wasted and incense enough
offered on these foul altars. It is also meant to
kindle thankfulness for the strong, loving hand which
has drawn them from that pit of filth, and by both
emotions to stimulate the resolute casting aside of
that evil in which they once, like others, wallowed.
Their joy on the one hand and their contrition on
the other should lead them to discern the inconsistency
of professing to be Christians and yet
keeping terms with these old sins. They could not
have the roots of half their lives above and of the
other half down here. The gulf between the present
and past of a regenerate man is too wide and deep
to be bridged by flimsy compromises. &ldquo;A man
who is perverse in his two ways,&rdquo; that is, in double
ways, &ldquo;shall fall in one of them,&rdquo; as the Book of
Proverbs has it. The attempt to combine incompatibles
is sure to fail. It is impossible to walk
firmly if one foot be down in the gutter and the
other up on the curb-stone. We have to settle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
which level we shall choose, and then to plant both
feet there.</p>

<p>V. We have, as conclusion, a still wider exhortation
to an entire stripping off of the sins of the old
state.</p>

<p>The whole force of the contrast and contrariety
between the Colossian Christians&#8217; past and present
lies in that emphatic &ldquo;now.&rdquo; They as well as other
heathen had been walking, because they had been
living, in these muddy ways. But now that their
life was hid with Christ in God; now that they had
been made partakers of His death and resurrection,
and of all the new loves and affinities which therein
became theirs; now they must take heed that they
bring not that dead and foul past into this bright
and pure present, nor prolong winter and its frosts
into the summer of the soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye also.&rdquo; There is another &ldquo;ye also&rdquo; in the
previous verse&mdash;&ldquo;ye also walked,&rdquo; that is, you in
company with other Gentiles followed a certain
course of life. Here, by contrast, the expression
means &ldquo;you, in common with other Christians.&rdquo; A
motive enforcing the subsequent exhortation is in it
hinted rather than fully spoken. The Christians
at Colossæ had belonged to a community which
they have now left in order to join another. Let
them behave as their company behaves. Let them
keep step with their new comrades. Let them
strip themselves, as their new associates do, of the
uniform which they wore in that other regiment.</p>

<p>The metaphor of putting clothing on or off is
very frequent in this Epistle. The precept here is
substantially equivalent to the previous command to
&ldquo;slay,&rdquo; with the difference that the conception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
vices as the garments of the soul is somewhat less
vehement than that which regards them as members
of the very self. &ldquo;All these&rdquo; are to be put off.
That phrase points back to the things previously
spoken of. It includes the whole of the unnamed
members of the class, of which a few have been
already named, and a handful more are about to be
plucked like poison flowers, and suggests that there
are many more as baleful growing by the side of
this devil&#8217;s bouquet which is next presented.</p>

<p>As to this second catalogue of vices, they may be
summarised as, on the whole, being various forms
of wicked hatred, in contrast with the former list,
which consisted of various forms of wicked love.
They have less to do with bodily appetites. But
perhaps it is not without profound meaning that
the fierce rush of unhallowed passion over the soul
is put first, and the contrary flow of chill malignity
comes second; for in the spiritual world, as in the
physical, a storm blowing from one quarter is usually
followed by violent gales from the opposite. Lust
ever passes into cruelty, and dwells &ldquo;hard by hate.&rdquo;
A licentious epoch or man is generally a cruel epoch
or man. Nero made torches of the Christians.
Malice is evil desire iced.</p>

<p>This second list goes in the opposite direction to
the former. That began with actions and went up
the stream to desire; this begins with the sources,
which are emotions, and comes down stream to their
manifestations in action.</p>

<p>First we have anger. There is a just and righteous
anger, which is part of the new man, and essential to
his completeness, even as it is part of the image after
which he is created. But here of course the anger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which is to be put off is the inverted reflection of the
earthly and passionate lust after the flesh; it is, then,
of an earthly, passionate and selfish kind. &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo;
differs from &ldquo;anger&rdquo; in so far as it may be called
anger boiling over. If anger rises keep the lid on,
do not let it get the length of wrath, nor effervesce
into the brief madness of passion. But on the other
hand, do not think that you have done enough when
you have suppressed the wrath which is the expression
of your anger, nor be content with saying,
&ldquo;Well, at all events I did not show it,&rdquo; but take the
cure a step further back, and strip off anger as well
as wrath, the emotion as well as the manifestation.</p>

<p>Christian people do not sufficiently bring the
greatest forces of their religion and of God&#8217;s Spirit
to bear upon the homely task of curing small hastinesses
of temper, and sometimes seem to think it a
sufficient excuse to say, &ldquo;I have naturally a hot
disposition.&rdquo; But Christianity was sent to subdue
and change natural dispositions. An angry man
cannot have communion with God, any more than
the sky can be reflected in the storm-swept tide;
and a man in communion with God cannot be angry
with a passionate and evil anger any more than a
dove can croak like a raven or strike like a hawk.
Such anger disturbs our insight into everything;
eyes suffused with it cannot see; and it weakens all
good in the soul, and degrades it before its own
conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malice&rdquo; designates another step in the process.
The anger boils over in wrath, and then cools down
into malignity&mdash;the disposition which means mischief,
and plans or rejoices in evil falling on the hated
head. That malice, as cold, as clear, as colourless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
as sulphuric acid, and burning like it, is worse than
the boiling rage already spoken of. There are
many degrees of this cold drawn, double distilled
rejoicing in evil, and the beginnings of it in a certain
faint satisfaction in the misfortunes of those whom
we dislike is by no means unusual.</p>

<p>An advance is now made in the direction of
outward manifestation. It is significant that while
the expressions of wicked love were deeds, those of
wicked hate are words. The &ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; of the
Authorised Version is better taken, with the Revised,
as &ldquo;railing.&rdquo; The word means &ldquo;speech that injures,&rdquo;
and such speech may be directed either
against God, which is blasphemy in the usual sense
of the word, or against man. The hate blossoms
into hurtful speech. The heated metal of anger is
forged into poisoned arrows of the tongue. Then
follows &ldquo;shameful speaking out of your mouth,&rdquo;
which is probably to be understood not so much of
obscenities, which would more properly belong to
the former catalogue, as of foul-mouthed abuse of
the hated persons, that copiousness of vituperation
and those volcanic explosions of mud, which are so
natural to the angry Eastern.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a dehortation from lying, especially
to those within the circle of the Church, as if
that sin too were the child of hatred and anger. It
comes from a deficiency of love, or a predominance
of selfishness, which is the same thing. A lie ignores
my brother&#8217;s claims on me, and my union with him.
&ldquo;Ye are members one of another,&rdquo; is the great obligation
to love which is denied and sinned against by
hatred in all its forms and manifestations, and not
least by giving my brother the poisoned bread of lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
instead of the heavenly manna of pure truth, so far
as it has been given to me.</p>

<p>On the whole, this catalogue brings out the importance
to be attached to sins of speech, which are
ranked here as in parallel lines with the grossest
forms of animal passion. Men&#8217;s words ought to be
fountains of consolation and sources of illumination,
encouragement, revelations of love and pity. And
what are they? What floods of idle words, foul
words, words that wound like knives and sting and
bite like serpents, deluge the world! If all the talk
that has its sources in these evils rebuked here, were
to be suddenly made inaudible, what a dead silence
would fall on many brilliant circles, and how many
of us would stand making mouths but saying
nothing.</p>

<p>All the practical exhortations of this section concern
common homely duties which everybody knows
to be such. It may be asked&mdash;does Christianity
then only lay down such plain precepts? What
need was there of all that prelude of mysterious doctrines,
if we are only to be landed at last in such
elementary and obvious moralities? No doubt they
are elementary and obvious, but the main matter
is&mdash;how to get them kept. And in respect to that,
Christianity does two things which nothing else
does. It breaks the entail of evil habits by the
great gift of pardon for the past, and by the greater
gift of a new spirit and life principle within, which is
foreign to all evil, being the effluence of the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Therefore the gospel of Jesus Christ makes it
possible that men should slay themselves, and put
on the new life, which will expel the old as the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
shoots on some trees push the last year&#8217;s lingering
leaves, brown and sere, from their places. All
moral teachers from the beginning have agreed, on
the whole, in their reading of the commandments
which are printed on conscience in the largest
capitals. Everybody who is not blind can read
them. But reading is easy, keeping is hard. How
to fulfil has been wanting. It is given us in the
gospel, which is not merely a republication of old
precepts, but the communication of new power. If
we yield ourselves to Christ He will nerve our arms
to wield the knife that will slay our dearest tastes,
though beloved as Isaac by Abraham. If a man
knows and feels that Christ has died for him, and
that he lives in and by Christ, then, and not else,
will he be able to crucify self. If he knows and
feels that by His pardoning mercy and atoning
death, Christ has taken off his foul raiment and
clothed him in clean garments, then, and not else,
will he be able, by daily effort after repression of
self and appropriation of Christ, to put off the old
man and to put on the new, which is daily being
renewed into closer resemblance to the image of
Him who created him.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE NEW NATURE WROUGHT OUT IN NEW LIFE.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, and have
put on the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after
the image of Him that created him: where there cannot be Greek and
Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman,
freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iii. 9&ndash;11 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>In previous section we were obliged to break the
close connection between these words and the
preceding. They adduce a reason for the moral
exhortation going before, which at first sight may
appear very illogical. &ldquo;Put off these vices of the old
nature because you have put off the old nature with
its vices,&rdquo; sounds like, Do a thing because you have
done it. But the apparent looseness of reasoning
covers very accurate thought which a little consideration
brings to light, and introduces a really cogent
argument for the conduct it recommends. Nor do
the principles contained in the verses now under
examination look backward only to enforce the
exhortation to put aside these evils. They also
look forward, and are taken as the basis of the
following exhortation, to put on the white robes of
Christlikeness&mdash;which is coupled with this section by
&ldquo;therefore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. The first thing to be observed is the change
of the spirit&#8217;s dress, which is taken for granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as having occurred in the experience of all Christians.</p>

<p>We have already found the same idea presented
under the forms of death and resurrection. The
&ldquo;death&rdquo; is equivalent to the &ldquo;putting off of the
old,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;resurrection&rdquo; to &ldquo;the putting on of
the new man.&rdquo; That figure of a change of dress to
express a change of moral character is very obvious,
and is frequent in Scripture. Many a psalm breathes
such prayers as, &ldquo;Let Thy priests be clothed with
righteousness.&rdquo; Zechariah in vision saw the high-priestly
representative of the nation standing before
the Lord &ldquo;in filthy garments,&rdquo; and heard the command
to strip them off him, and clothe him in festival
robes, in token that God had &ldquo;caused his iniquity to
pass from him.&rdquo; Christ spoke His parable of the
man at the wedding feast without the wedding garment,
and of the prodigal, who was stripped of his
rags stained with the filth of the swine troughs, and
clothed with the best robe. Paul in many places
touches the same image, as in his ringing exhortation&mdash;clear
and rousing in its notes like the morning
bugle&mdash;to Christ&#8217;s soldiers, to put off their night
gear, &ldquo;the works of darkness,&rdquo; and to brace on the
armour of light, which sparkles in the morning sunrise.
Every reformatory and orphanage yields an
illustration of the image, where the first thing done
is to strip off and burn the rags of the new comers,
then to give them a bath and dress them in clean,
sweet, new clothes. Most naturally dress is taken
as the emblem of character, which is indeed the garb
of the soul. Most naturally <i>habit</i> means both
<i>costume</i> and <i>custom</i>.</p>

<p>But here we have a strange paradox introduced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to the ruining of the rhetorical propriety of the
figure. It is a &ldquo;new man&rdquo; that is put on. The
Apostle does not mind hazarding a mixed metaphor,
if it adds to the force of his speech, and he introduces
this thought of the new <i>man</i>, though it somewhat
jars, in order to impress on his readers that what
they have to put off and on is much more truly part
of themselves than an article of dress is. The &ldquo;old
man&rdquo; is the unregenerate self; the new man is, of
course, the regenerate self, the new Christian moral
nature personified. There is a deeper self which
remains the same throughout the change, the true
man, the centre of personality; which is, as it were,
draped in the moral nature, and can put it off and
on. I myself change myself. The figure is vehement,
and, if you will, paradoxical, but it expresses
accurately and forcibly at once the depth of the
change which passes on him who becomes a Christian,
and the identity of the person through all
change. If I am a Christian, there has passed on
me a change so thorough that it is in one aspect a
death, and in another a resurrection; in one aspect
it is a putting off not merely of some garb of action,
but of the old <i>man</i>, and in another a putting on not
merely of some surface renovation, but of a new
<i>man</i>&mdash;which is yet the same old self.</p>

<p>This entire change is taken for granted by Paul
as having been realised in every Christian. It is
here treated as having taken place at a certain point
of time, namely when these Colossians began to put
their trust in Jesus Christ, and in profession of that
trust, and as a symbol of that change, were baptized.</p>

<p>Of course the contrast between the character
before and after faith in Christ is strongest when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
like the Christians at Colossæ, converts have been
brought out of heathenism. With us, where some
knowledge of Christianity is widely diffused, and its
indirect influence has shaped the characters even of
those who reject it, there is less room for a marked
revolution in character and conduct. There will be
many true saints who can point to no sudden change
as their conversion; but have grown up, sometimes
from childhood, under Christian influences, or who,
if they have distinctly been conscious of a change,
have passed through it as gradually as night passes
into day. Be it so. In many respects that will
be the highest form of experience. Yet even such
souls will be aware of a &ldquo;new man&rdquo; formed in
them which is at variance with their own old selves,
and will not escape the necessity of the conflict with
their lower nature, the immolation and casting off
of the unregenerate self. But there are also many
people who have grown up without God or Christ,
who must become Christians by the way of sudden
conversion, if they are ever to become Christians
at all.</p>

<p>Why should such sudden change be regarded
as impossible? Is it not a matter of every-day
experience that some long ignored principle may
suddenly come, like a meteor into the atmosphere,
into a man&#8217;s mind and will, may catch fire as it
travels, and may explode and blow to pieces the
solid habits of a lifetime? And why should not the
truth concerning God&#8217;s great love in Christ, which
in too sad certainty is ignored by many, flame in
upon blind eyes, and change the look of everything?
The New Testament doctrine of conversion asserts
that it may and does. It does not insist that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
everybody must become a Christian in the same
fashion. Sometimes there will be a dividing line
between the two states, as sharp as the boundary
of adjoining kingdoms; sometimes the one will melt
imperceptibly into the other. Sometimes the revolution
will be as swift as that of the wheel of a
locomotive, sometimes slow and silent as the movement
of a planet in the sky. The main thing is
that whether suddenly or slowly the face shall be
turned to God.</p>

<p>But however brought about, this putting off of
the old sinful self, is a certain mark of a Christian
man. It can be assumed as true universally, and
appealed to as the basis of exhortations such as
those of the context. Believing certain truths does
not make a Christian. If there have been any
reality in the act by which we have laid hold of
Christ as our Saviour, our whole being will be
revolutionized; old things will have passed away&mdash;tastes,
desires, ways of looking at the world, memories,
habits, pricks of conscience and all cords that bound
us to our God-forgetting past&mdash;and all things will
have become new, because we ourselves move in the
midst of the old things as new creatures with new
love burning in our hearts and new motives changing
all our lives, and a new aim shining before us, and
a new hope illuminating the blackness beyond, and
a new song on our lips, and a new power in our
hands, and a new Friend by our sides.</p>

<p>This is a wholesome and most needful test for all
who call themselves Christians, and who are often
tempted to put too much stress on believing and
feeling, and to forget the supreme importance of the
moral change which true Christianity effects. Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
is it less needful to remember that this resolute
casting off of the garment spotted by the flesh, and
putting on of the new man, is a consequence of faith
in Christ and is only possible as a consequence.
Nothing else will strip the foul robes from a man.
The moral change comes second, the union with
Jesus Christ by faith must come first. To try to
begin with the second stage, is like trying to begin
to build a house at the second story.</p>

<p>But there is a practical conclusion drawn from
this taken-for-granted change. Our text is introduced
by &ldquo;seeing that;&rdquo; and though some doubts
may be raised as to that translation and the logical
connection of the paragraph, it appears on the whole
most congruous with both the preceding and the
following context, to retain it and to see here the
reason for the exhortation which goes before&mdash;&ldquo;Put
off all these,&rdquo; and for that which follows&mdash;&ldquo;Put on,
therefore,&rdquo; the beautiful garment of love and compassion.</p>

<p>That great change, though taking place in the
inmost nature whensoever a heart turns to Christ,
needs to be wrought into character, and to be
wrought out in conduct. The leaven is in the dough,
but to knead it thoroughly into the mass is a lifelong
task, which is only accomplished by our own
continually repeated efforts. The old garment clings
to the limbs like the wet clothes of a half-drowned
man, and it takes the work of a lifetime to get quite
rid of it. The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; dies hard, and we have
to repeat the sacrifice hour by hour. The new man
has to be put on afresh day by day.</p>

<p>So the apparently illogical exhortation, Put off
what you have put off, and put on what you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
put on, is fully vindicated. It means, Be consistent
with your deepest selves. Carry out in detail what
you have already done in bulk. Cast out the enemy,
already ejected from the central fortress, from the
isolated positions which he still occupies. You
<i>may</i> put off the old man, for he is put off already;
and the confidence that he is will give you strength
for the struggle that still remains. You <i>must</i> put
off the old man, for there is still danger of his again
wrapping his poisonous rags about your limbs.</p>

<p>II. We have here, the continuous growth of the
new man, its aim and pattern.</p>

<p>The thought of the garment passes for the
moment out of sight, and the Apostle enlarges on
the greatness and glory of this &ldquo;new man,&rdquo; partly
as a stimulus to obeying the exhortation, partly,
with allusion to some of the errors which he had
been combating, and partly because his fervid spirit
kindles at the mention of the mighty transformation.</p>

<p>The new man, says he, is &ldquo;being renewed.&rdquo;
This is one of the instances where minute accuracy
in translation is not pedantic, but clear gain. When
we say, with the Authorised Version, &ldquo;is renewed,&rdquo;
we speak of a completed act; when we say with the
Revised Version, &ldquo;is being renewed,&rdquo; we speak of a
continuous process; and there can be no question
that the latter is the true idea intended here. The
growth of the new man is constant, perhaps slow
and difficult to discern, if the intervals of comparison
be short. But like all habits and powers it steadily
increases. On the other hand, a similar process
works to opposite results in the &ldquo;old man,&rdquo; which,
as Paul says in the instructive parallel passage in
the Epistle to the Ephesians (iv. 22), &ldquo;waxeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
corrupt, after the lusts of deceit.&rdquo; Both grow
according to their inmost nature, the one steadily
upwards; the other with accelerating speed downwards,
till they are parted by the whole distance
between the highest heaven and the lowest abyss.
So mystic and awful is that solemn law of the
persistent increase of the true ruling tendency of a
man&#8217;s nature, and its certain subjugation of the
whole man to itself!</p>

<p>It is to be observed that this renewing is represented
in this clause, as done <i>on</i> the new man, not
by him. We have heard the exhortation to a
continuous appropriation and increase of the new
life by our own efforts. But there is a Divine side
too, and the renewing is not merely effected by us,
nor due only to the vital power of the new man,
though growth is the sign of life there as everywhere,
but is &ldquo;the renewing by the Holy Ghost,&rdquo;
whose touch quickens and whose indwelling renovates
the inward man day by day. So there is
hope for us in our striving, for He helps us; and
the thought of that Divine renewal is not a pillow
for indolence, but a spur to intenser energy, as Paul
well knew when he wove the apparent paradox,
&ldquo;work out your own salvation, for it is God that
worketh in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new man is being renewed &ldquo;<i>unto</i> knowledge.&rdquo;
An advanced knowledge of God and Divine realities
is the result of the progressive renewal. Possibly
there may be a passing reference to the pretensions
of the false teachers, who had so much to say about
a higher wisdom open to the initiated, and to be
won by ceremonial and asceticism. Their claims,
hints Paul, are baseless; their pretended secrets a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
delusion; their method of attaining them a snare.
There is but one way to press into the depths of the
knowledge of God&mdash;namely growth into His likeness.
We understand one another best by sympathy.
We know God only on condition of resemblance.
&ldquo;If the eye were not sunlike how could it see the
sun?&rdquo; says Goethe. &ldquo;If thou beest this, thou
seest this,&rdquo; said Plotinus. Ever, as we grow in
resemblance, shall we grow in knowledge, and ever
as we grow in knowledge, shall we grow in resemblance.
So in perpetual action and reaction of
being and knowing, shall we draw nearer and
nearer the unapproachable light, and receiving it full
on our faces, shall be changed into the same image,
as the moonbeams that touch the dark ocean transfigure
its waves into silver radiance like their own.
For all simple souls, bewildered by the strife of
tongues and unapt for speculation, this is a message
of gladness, that the way to know God is to be like
Him, and the way to be like Him is to be renewed
in the inward man, and the way to be renewed in
the inward man is to put on Christ. They may
wrangle and philosophize who will, but the path
to God leads far away from all that. It may be
trodden by a child&#8217;s foot, and the wayfaring man
though a fool shall not err therein, for all that is
needed is a heart that desires to know Him, and
is made like Him by love. Half the secret lies in
the great word which tells us that &ldquo;we shall be like
Him, for we shall see Him as He is,&rdquo; and knowledge
will work likeness. The other half lies in the
great word which tells us that &ldquo;blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God,&rdquo; and likeness will
work a more perfect knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
This new man is being renewed <i>after the image of
Him that created him</i>. As in the first creation man
was made in the image of God, so in the new
creation. From the first moment in which the
supernatural life is derived from Christ into the regenerated
spirit, that new life is like its source. It
is kindred, therefore it is like, as all derived life is.
The child&#8217;s life is like the father&#8217;s. But the image
of God which the new man bears is more than that
which was stamped on man in his creation. That
consisted mainly, if not wholly, in the reasonable
soul, and the self-conscious personality, the broad
distinctions which separate man from other animals.
The image of God is often said to have been lost
by sin, but Scripture seems rather to consider it
as inseparable from humanity, even when stained by
transgression. Men are still images of God, though
darkened and &ldquo;carved in ebony.&rdquo; The coin bears
His image and superscription, though rusty and defaced.
But the image of God, which the new man
bears from the beginning in a rudimentary form, and
which is continually imprinting itself more deeply
upon him, has for its principal feature holiness.
Though the majestic infinitudes of God can have
no likeness in man, however exalted, and our feebleness
cannot copy His strength, nor our poor blind
knowledge, with its vast circumference of ignorance,
be like His ungrowing and unerring knowledge, we
may be &ldquo;holy <i>as</i> He is holy&rdquo;; we may be &ldquo;imitators
of God as beloved children, and walk in love
as He hath loved us&rdquo;; we may &ldquo;<i>walk</i> in the light
as He <i>is</i> in the light,&rdquo; with only the difference
between His calm, eternal being, and our changeful
and progressive motion therein; we may even &ldquo;be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
perfect as our Father is perfect.&rdquo; This is the end
of all our putting off the old and putting on the new.
This is the ultimate purpose of God, in all His self-revelation.
For this Christ has come and died and
lives. For this the Spirit of God dwells in us. This
is the immortal hope with which we may re-create
and encourage our souls in our often weary struggles.
Even our poor sinful natures may be transformed
into that wondrous likeness. Coal and diamond are
but varying forms of carbon, and the blackest lump
dug from the deepest mine, may be transmuted by
the alchemy of that wondrous transforming union
with Christ, into a brightness that shall flash back
all the glory of the sunlight, and gleam for ever, set
in one of His many crowns.</p>

<p>III. We have here finally the grand unity of this
new creation.</p>

<p>We may reverse the order of the words as they
stand here, and consider the last clause first, inasmuch
as it is the reason for the doing away of all
distinctions of race, or ceremony, or culture, or social
condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christ is all.&rdquo; Wherever that new nature is
found, it lives by the life of Christ. He dwells in
all who possess it. The Spirit of life in Christ is in
them. His blood passes into their veins. The holy
desires, the new tastes, the kindling love, the clearer
vision, the gentleness and the strength, and whatsoever
things beside are lovely and of good report,
are all His&mdash;nay, we may say, are all Himself.</p>

<p>And, of course, all who are His are partakers of that
common gift, and He is <i>in</i> all. There is no privileged
class in Christ&#8217;s Church, as these false teachers
in Colossæ had taught. Against every attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
limit the universality of the gospel, whether it came
from Jewish Pharisees or Eastern philosophers, Paul
protested with his whole soul. He has done so
already in this Epistle, and does so here in his
emphatic assertion that Christ was not the possession
of an aristocracy of &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; but belonged to
every soul that trusted Him.</p>

<p>Necessarily, therefore, surface distinctions disappear.
There is triumph in the roll of his rapid
enumeration of these clefts that have so long kept
brothers apart, and are now being filled up. He
looks round on a world, the antagonisms of which
we can but faintly imagine, and his eye kindles and
his voice rises into vibrating emotion, as he thinks
of the mighty magnetism that is drawing enemies
towards the one centre in Christ. His catalogue
here may profitably be compared with his other in
the Epistle to the Galatians (iii. 28). There he
enumerates the three great distinctions which parted
the old world: race (Jew and Greek), social condition
(bond and free), and sex (male and female.)
These, he says, as separating powers, are done away
in Christ. Here the list is modified, probably with
reference to the errors in the Colossian Church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There cannot be Greek and Jew.&rdquo; The cleft of
national distinctions, which certainly never yawned
more widely than between the Jew and every other
people, ceases to separate, and the teachers who had
been trying to perpetuate that distinction in the
Church were blind to the very meaning of the
gospel. &ldquo;Circumcision and uncircumcision&rdquo; separated.
Nothing makes deeper and bitterer antagonisms
than differences in religious forms, and
people who have not been born into them are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
usually the most passionate in adherence to them, so
that cleft did not entirely coincide with the former.
&ldquo;Barbarian, Scythian,&rdquo; is not an antithesis, but a
climax&mdash;the Scythians were looked upon as the
most savage of barbarians. The Greek contempt
for the outside races, which is reflected in this
clause, was largely the contempt for a supposed
lower stage of culture. As we have seen, Colossæ
especially needed the lesson that differences in culture
disappeared in the unity of Christ, for the heretical
teachers attached great importance to the wisdom
which they professed to impart. A cultivated class
is always tempted to superciliousness, and a half cultivated
class is even more so. There is abundance
of that arrogance born of education among us to-day,
and sorely needing and quite disbelieving the
teaching that there are things which can make up
for the want of what it possesses. It is in the
interest of the humble virtues of the uneducated
godly as well as of the nations called uncivilized,
that Christianity wars against that most heartless
and ruinous of all prides, the pride of culture, by its
proclamation that in Christ, barbarian, Scythian
and the most polished thinker or scholar are one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bondman, freeman&rdquo; is again an antithesis.
That gulf between master and slave was indeed wide
and deep; too wide for compassion to cross, though
not for hatred to stride over. The untold miseries
of slavery in the old world are but dimly known;
but it and war and the degradation of women made
an infernal trio which crushed more than half the
race into a hell of horrors. Perhaps Paul may have
been the more ready to add this clause to his catalogue
because his thoughts had been occupied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the relation of master and slave on the occasion of
the letter to Philemon which was sent along with
this to Colossæ.</p>

<p>Christianity waged no direct war against these
social evils of antiquity, but it killed them much
more effectually by breathing into the conscience of
the world truths which made their continuance impossible.
It girdled the tree, and left it to die&mdash;a
much better and more thorough plan than dragging
it out of the ground by main force. Revolution
cures nothing. The only way to get rid of evils
engrained in the constitution of society is to elevate
and change the tone of thought and feeling, and
then they die of atrophy. Change the climate, and
you change the vegetation. Until you do, neither
mowing nor uprooting will get rid of the foul
growths.</p>

<p>So the gospel does with all these lines of demarcation
between men. What becomes of them?
What becomes of the ridges of sand that separate
pool from pool at low water? The tide comes up
over them and makes them all one, gathered into
the oneness of the great sea. They may remain,
but they are seen no more, and the roll of the wave
is not interrupted by them. The powers and blessings
of the Christ pass freely from heart to heart,
hindered by no barriers. Christ founds a deeper
unity independent of all these superficial distinctions,
for the very conception of humanity is the product
of Christianity, and the true foundation for the
brotherhood of mankind is the revelation in Christ
of the fatherhood of God. Christ is the brother
of us all; His death is for every man; the blessing
of His gospel is offered to each; He will dwell in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the heart of any. Therefore all distinctions, national,
ceremonial, intellectual or social, fade into nothingness.
Love is of no nation, and Christ is the property
of no aristocracy in the Church. That great
truth was a miraculous new thing in that old world,
all torn apart by deep clefts like the grim cañons
of American rivers. Strange it must have seemed
to find slaves and their masters, Jew and Greek,
sitting at one table and bound in fraternal ties.
The world has not yet fully grasped that truth, and
the Church has woefully failed in showing it to be
a reality. But it arches above all our wars, and
schisms, and wretched class distinctions, like a rainbow
of promise, beneath whose open portal the
world shall one day pass into that bright land where
the wandering peoples shall gather together in peace
round the feet of Jesus, and there shall be one fold
because there is one Shepherd.</p>

<h2><a name="ColXX" id="ColXX"></a>XX.<br />
<span class="titlesmaller"><i>THE GARMENTS OF THE RENEWED SOUL.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Put on therefore, as God&#8217;s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of
compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing
one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint
against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: and above all
these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iii.12&ndash;14 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We need not repeat what has been already
said as to the logic of the inference, You
have put off the &ldquo;old man,&rdquo; therefore put off the
vices which belong to him. Here we have the same
argument in reference to the &ldquo;new man&rdquo; who is to be
&ldquo;put on&rdquo; because he has been put on. This &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;
rests the exhortation both on that thought,
and on the nearer words, &ldquo;Christ is all and in all.&rdquo;
Because the new nature has been assumed in the
very act of conversion, therefore array your souls in
vesture corresponding. Because Christ is all and
in all, therefore clothe yourselves with all brotherly
graces, corresponding to the great unity into which
all Christians are brought by their common possession
of Christ. The whole field of Christian morality
is not traversed here, but only so much of it as
concerns the social duties which result from that
unity.</p>

<p>But besides the foundation for the exhortations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
which is laid in the possession of the &ldquo;New Man,&rdquo;
consequent on participation in Christ, another ground
for them is added in the words, &ldquo;as God&#8217;s elect,
holy and beloved.&rdquo; Those who are in Christ and
are thus regenerated in Him, are of the chosen race,
are consecrated as belonging especially to God, and
receive the warm beams of the special paternal love
with which He regards the men who are in some
measure conformed to His likeness and moulded
after His will. That relation to God should draw
after it a life congruous with itself&mdash;a life of active
goodness and brotherly gentleness. The outcome of
it should be not mere glad emotion, nor a hugging
of one&#8217;s self in one&#8217;s happiness, but practical efforts
to turn to men a face lit by the same dispositions
with which God has looked on us, or as the parallel
passage in Ephesians has it, &ldquo;Be imitators of God,
as beloved children.&rdquo; That is a wide and fruitful
principle&mdash;the relation to men will follow the relation
to God. As we think God has been to us, so let
us try to be to others. The poorest little fishing
cobble is best guided by celestial observations, and
dead reckoning without sun or stars is but second
best. Independent morality cut loose from religion
will be feeble morality. On the other hand, religion
which does not issue in morality is a ghost without
substance. Religion is the soul of morality.
Morality is the body of religion, more than ceremonial
worship is. The virtues which all men know,
are the fitting garments of the elect of God.</p>

<p>I. We have here then an enumeration of the fair
garments of the new man.</p>

<p>Let us go over the items of this list of the wardrobe
of the consecrated soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
&ldquo;A heart of compassion.&rdquo; So the Revised Version
renders the words given literally in the Authorised
as &ldquo;bowels of mercies,&rdquo; an expression which that
very strange thing called conventional propriety
regards as coarse, simply because Jews chose one
part of the body and we another as the supposed
seat of the emotions. Either phrase expresses substantially
the Apostle&#8217;s meaning.</p>

<p>Is it not beautiful that the series should begin
with <i>pity</i>? It is the most often needed, for the sea
of sorrow stretches so widely that nothing less than
a universal compassion can arch it over as with the
blue of heaven. Every man would seem in some
respect deserving of and needing sympathy, if his
whole heart and history could be laid bare. Such
compassion is difficult to achieve, for its healing
streams are dammed back by many obstructions of
inattention and occupation, and dried up by the
fierce heat of selfishness. Custom, with its deadening
influence, comes in to make us feel least the
sorrows which are most common in the society
around us. As a man might live so long in an
asylum that lunacy would seem to him almost the
normal condition, so the most widely diffused griefs
are those least observed and least compassionated;
and good, tender-hearted men and women walk the
streets of our great cities and see sights&mdash;children
growing up for the gallows and the devil, gin-shops
at every corner&mdash;which might make angels weep,
and suppose them to be as inseparable from our
&ldquo;civilization&rdquo; as the noise of wheels from a carriage
or bilge water from a ship. Therefore we have to
make conscious efforts to &ldquo;put on&rdquo; that sympathetic
disposition, and to fight against the faults which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
hinder its free play. Without it, no help will be of
much use to the receiver, nor of any to the giver.
Benefits bestowed on the needy and sorrowful, if
bestowed without sympathy, will hurt like a blow.
Much is said about ingratitude, but very often it is
but the instinctive recoil of the heart from the unkind
doer of a kindness. Aid flung to a man as a bone
is to a dog usually gets as much gratitude as the
sympathy which it expresses deserves. But if we
really make another&#8217;s sorrows ours, that teaches us
tact and gentleness, and makes our clumsy hands
light and deft to bind up sore hearts.</p>

<p>Above all things, the practical discipline which
cultivates pity will beware of letting it be excited
and then not allowing the emotion to act. To
stimulate feeling and do nothing in consequence is
a short road to destroy the feeling. Pity is meant
to be the impulse toward help, and if it is checked
and suffered to pass away idly, it is weakened, as
certainly as a plant is weakened by being kept close
nipped and hindered from bringing its buds to flower
and fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindness&rdquo; comes next&mdash;a wider benignity, not
only exercised where there is manifest room for
pity, but turning a face of goodwill to all. Some
souls are so dowered that they have this grace without
effort, and come like the sunshine with welcome
and cheer for all the world. But even less happily
endowed natures can cultivate the disposition, and
the best way to cultivate it is to be much in communion
with God. When Moses came down from
the mount, his face shone. When we come out from
the secret place of the Most High we shall bear
some reflection of His great kindness whose &ldquo;tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
mercies are over all His works.&rdquo; This &ldquo;kindness&rdquo;
is the opposite of that worldly wisdom, on which
many men pride themselves as the ripe fruit of their
knowledge of men and things, and which keeps up
vigilant suspicion of everybody, as in the savage
state, where &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; and &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; had only one
word between them. It does not require us to be
blind to facts or to live in fancies, but it does require
us to cherish a habit of goodwill, ready to become
pity if sorrow appears, and slow to turn away even
if hostility appears. Meet your brother with kindness,
and you will generally find it returned. The
prudent hypocrites who get on in the world, as ships
are launched, by &ldquo;greasing the ways&rdquo; with flattery,
and smiles, teach us the value of the true thing, since
even a coarse caricature of it wins hearts and disarms
foes. This &ldquo;kindness&rdquo; is the most powerful solvent
of illwill and indifference.</p>

<p>Then follows &ldquo;humility.&rdquo; That seems to break
the current of thought by bringing a virtue entirely
occupied with self into the middle of a series referring
exclusively to others. But it does not really do
so. From this point onwards all the graces named
have reference to our demeanour under slights and
injuries&mdash;and humility comes into view here only as
constituting the foundation for the right bearing of
these. Meekness and longsuffering must stand on
a basis of humility. The proud man, who thinks
highly of himself and of his own claims, will be the
touchy man, if any one derogates from these.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humility,&rdquo; or lowly-mindedness, a lowly estimate
of ourselves, is not necessarily blindness to our
strong points. If a man can do certain things better
than his neighbours, he can hardly help knowing it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and Christian humility does not require him to be
ignorant of it. I suppose Milton would be none the
less humble, though he was quite sure that his work
was better than that of Sternhold and Hopkins.
The consciousness of power usually accompanies
power. But though it may be quite right to &ldquo;know
myself&rdquo; in the strong points, as well as in the weak,
there are two considerations which should act as
dampers to any unchristian fire of pride which the
devil&#8217;s breath may blow up from that fuel. The
one is, &ldquo;What hast thou that thou hast not received?&rdquo;
the other is, &ldquo;Who is pure before God&#8217;s
judgment-seat?&rdquo; Your strong points are nothing
so very wonderful, after all. If you have better
brains than some of your neighbours, well, that is
not a thing to give yourself such airs about. Besides,
where did you get the faculties you plume yourself
on? However cultivated by yourself, how came
they yours at first? And, furthermore, whatever
superiorities may lift you above any men, and however
high you may be elevated, it is a long way from
the top of the highest molehill to the sun, and not
much longer to the top of the lowest. And, besides
all that, you may be very clever and brilliant, may
have made books or pictures, may have stamped
your name on some invention, may have won a
place in public life, or made a fortune&mdash;and yet you
and the beggar who cannot write his name are both
guilty before God. Pride seems out of place in
creatures like us, who have all to bow our heads in
the presence of His perfect judgment, and cry, &ldquo;God
be merciful to me a sinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then follow &ldquo;meekness, long-suffering.&rdquo; The
distinction between these two is slight. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
to the most thorough investigators, the former is the
temper which accepts God&#8217;s dealings, or evil inflicted
by men as His instruments, without resistance, while
the latter is the long holding out of the mind before
it gives way to a temptation to action, or passion,
especially the latter. The opposite of meekness is
rudeness or harshness; the opposite of long-suffering,
swift resentment or revenge. Perhaps there may be
something in the distinction, that while long-suffering
does not get angry soon, meekness does not get
angry at all. Possibly, too, meekness implies a
lowlier position than long-suffering does. The meek
man puts himself below the offender; the long-suffering
man does not. God is long-suffering, but
the incarnate God alone can be &ldquo;meek and lowly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general meaning is plain enough. The &ldquo;hate
of hate,&rdquo; the &ldquo;scorn of scorn,&rdquo; is not the Christian
ideal. I am not to allow my enemy always to
settle the terms on which we are to be. Why should
I scowl back at him, though he frowns at me? It
is hard work, as we all know, to repress the retort
that would wound and be so neat. It is hard not
to repay slights and offences in kind. But, if the
basis of our dispositions to others be laid in a
wise and lowly estimate of ourselves, such graces of
conduct will be possible, and they will give beauty
to our characters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forbearing and forgiving&rdquo; are not new virtues.
They are meekness and long-suffering in exercise,
and if we were right in saying that &ldquo;long-suffering&rdquo;
was not <i>soon</i> angry, and &ldquo;meekness&rdquo; was not
angry at all, then &ldquo;forbearance&rdquo; would correspond
to the former and &ldquo;forgiveness&rdquo; to the latter;
for a man may exercise forbearance, and bite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
his lips till the blood come rather than speak, and
violently constrain himself to keep calm and do
nothing unkind, and yet all the while seven devils
may be in his spirit; while forgiveness, on the other
hand, is an entire wiping of all enmity and irritation
clean out of the heart.</p>

<p>Such is the Apostle&#8217;s outline sketch of the
Christian character in its social aspect, all rooted
in pity, and full of soft compassion; quick to
apprehend, to feel, and to succour sorrow; a kindliness,
equable and widespread, illuminating all who
come within its reach; a patient acceptance of
wrongs without resentment or revenge, because a
lowly judgment of self and its claims, a spirit
schooled to calmness under all provocations, disdaining
to requite wrong by wrong, and quick to forgive.</p>

<p>The question may well be asked&mdash;is that a type
of character which the world generally admires? Is
it not uncommonly like what most people would
call &ldquo;a poor spiritless creature.&rdquo; It was &ldquo;a new
man,&rdquo; most emphatically, when Paul drew that
sketch, for the heathen world had never seen anything
like it. It is a &ldquo;new man&rdquo; still; for although
the modern world has had some kind of Christianity&mdash;at
least has had a Church&mdash;for all these centuries,
that is not the kind of character which is its ideal.
Look at the heroes of history and of literature.
Look at the tone of so much contemporary biography
and criticism of public actions. Think of
the ridicule which is poured on the attempt to
regulate politics by Christian principles, or, as a
distinguished soldier called them in public recently,
&ldquo;puling principles.&rdquo; It may be true that Christianity
has not added any new virtues to those which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
prescribed by natural conscience, but it has most
certainly altered the perspective of the whole, and
created a type of excellence, in which the gentler
virtues predominate, and the novelty of which is
proved by the reluctance of the so-called Christian
world to recognise it even yet.</p>

<p>By the side of its serene and lofty beauty, the
&ldquo;heroic virtues&rdquo; embodied in the world&#8217;s type of
excellence show vulgar and glaring, like some daub
representing a soldier, the sign-post of a public-house,
by the side of Angelico&#8217;s white-robed visions
on the still convent walls. The highest exercise of
these more gaudy and conspicuous qualities is to
produce the pity and meekness of the Christian
ideal. More self-command, more heroic firmness,
more contempt for the popular estimate, more of
everything strong and manly, will find a nobler field
in subduing passion and cherishing forgiveness,
which the world thinks folly and spiritless, than anywhere
else. Better is he that ruleth his spirit than
he that taketh a city.</p>

<p><i>The great pattern and motive of forgiveness</i> is
next set forth. We are to forgive as Christ has
forgiven us; and that &ldquo;as&rdquo; may be applied either
as meaning &ldquo;in like manner,&rdquo; or as meaning
&ldquo;because.&rdquo; The Revised Version, with many
others, adopts the various reading of &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; which has the advantage of
recalling the parable that was no doubt in Paul&#8217;s
mind, about the servant who, having been forgiven
by his &ldquo;<i>Lord</i>&rdquo; all his great debt, took his fellow-servant
by the throat and squeezed the last farthing
out of him.</p>

<p>The great transcendent act of God&#8217;s mercy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
brought to us by Christ&#8217;s cross is sometimes, as in
the parallel passage in Ephesians, spoken of as
&ldquo;God for Christ&#8217;s sake forgiving us,&rdquo; and sometimes
as here, Christ is represented as forgiving. We
need not pause to do more than point to that interchange
of Divine office and attributes, and ask what
notion of Christ&#8217;s person underlies it.</p>

<p>We have already had the death of Christ set forth
as in a very profound sense our pattern. Here we
have one special case of the general law that the
life and death of our Lord are the embodied ideal
of human character and conduct. His forgiveness is
not merely revealed to us that trembling hearts may
be calm, and that a fearful looking for of judgment
may no more trouble a foreboding conscience. For
whilst we must ever begin with cleaving to it as our
hope, we must never stop there. A heart touched
and softened by pardon will be a heart apt to
pardon, and the miracle of forgiveness which has
been wrought for it will constitute the law of its life
as well as the ground of its joyful security.</p>

<p>This new pattern and new motive, both in one,
make the true novelty and specific difference of
Christian morality. &ldquo;As I have loved you,&rdquo; makes
the commandment &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; a new commandment.
And all that is difficult in obedience
becomes easier by the power of that motive. Imitation
of one whom we love is instinctive. Obedience
to one whom we love is delightful. The far off
ideal becomes near and real in the person of our
best friend. Bound to him by obligations so
immense, and a forgiveness so costly and complete,
we shall joyfully yield to &ldquo;the cords of love&rdquo; which
draw us after Him. We have each to choose what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
shall be the pattern for us. The world takes Cæsar,
the hero; the Christian takes Christ, in whose
meekness is power, and whose gentle long-suffering
has been victor in a sterner conflict than any battle
of the warrior with garments rolled in blood.</p>

<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Even as the Lord forgave you, so
also do ye.&rdquo; The Lord&#8217;s prayer teaches us to ask,
Forgive us our trespasses, as we also forgive. In
the one case Christ&#8217;s forgiveness is the example and
the motive for ours. In the other, our forgiveness
is the condition of God&#8217;s. Both are true. We shall
find the strongest impulse to pardon others in the
consciousness that we have been pardoned by Him.
And if we have grudgings against our offending
brother in our hearts, we shall not be conscious of
the tender forgiveness of our Father in heaven.
That is no arbitrary limitation, but inherent in the
very nature of the case.</p>

<p>II. We have here the girdle which keeps all the
garments in their places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Above all these things, put on love, which is the
bond of perfectness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Above all these&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;besides,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;more important than,&rdquo; but is clearly used in its
simplest local sense, as equivalent to &ldquo;over,&rdquo; and
thus carries on the metaphor of the dress. Over
the other garments is to be put the silken sash or
girdle of love, which will brace and confine all the
rest into a unity. It is &ldquo;the girdle of perfectness,&rdquo;
by which is not meant, as is often supposed, the
perfect principle of union among men. Perfectness
is not the quality of the girdle, but the thing which
it girds, and is a collective expression for &ldquo;the
various graces and virtues, which together make up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
perfection.&rdquo; So the metaphor expresses the thought
that love knits into a harmonious whole, the graces
which without it would be fragmentary and incomplete.</p>

<p>We can conceive of all the dispositions already
named as existing in some fashion without love.
There might be pity which was not love, though we
know it is akin to it. The feeling with which one
looks upon some poor outcast, or on some stranger
in sorrow, or even on an enemy in misery, may be
very genuine compassion, and yet clearly separate
from love. So with all the others. There may be
kindness most real without any of the diviner
emotion, and there may even be forbearance reaching
up to forgiveness, and yet leaving the heart
untouched in its deepest recesses. But if these
virtues were thus exercised, in the absence of love
they would be fragmentary, shallow, and would have
no guarantee for their own continuance. Let love
come into the heart and knit a man to the poor
creature whom he had only pitied before, or to the
enemy whom he had at the most been able with an
effort to forgive; and it lifts these other emotions
into a nobler life. He who pities may not love,
but he who loves cannot but pity; and that compassion
will flow with a deeper current and be of a
purer quality than the shrunken stream which does
not rise from that higher source.</p>

<p>Nor is it only the virtues enumerated here for which
love performs this office; but all the else isolated
graces of character, it binds or welds into a harmonious
whole. As the broad Eastern girdle holds
the flowing robes in position, and gives needed
firmness to the figure as well as composed order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the attire; so this broad band, woven of softest
fabric, keeps all emotions in their due place and
makes the attire of the Christian soul beautiful in
harmonious completeness.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is a yet deeper truth that love produces
all these graces. Whatsoever things men call virtues,
are best cultivated by cultivating it. So with a
somewhat similar meaning to that of our text, but
if anything, going deeper down, Paul in another
place calls love the fulfilling of the law, even as his
Master had taught him that all the complex of
duties incumbent upon us were summed up in love
to God, and love to men. Whatever I owe to my
brother will be discharged if I love God, and live
my love. Nothing of it, not even the smallest mite
of the debt will be discharged, however vast my
sacrifices and services, if I do not.</p>

<p>So end the frequent references in this letter to
putting off the old and putting on the new. The
sum of them all is, that we must first put on Christ
by faith, and then by daily effort clothe our spirits
in the graces of character which He gives us, and by
which we shall be like Him.</p>

<p>We have said that this dress of the Christian soul
which we have been now considering does not
include the whole of Christian duty. We may
recall the other application of the same figure which
occurs in the parallel Epistle to the Ephesians,
where Paul sketches for us in a few rapid touches
the armed Christian soldier. The two pictures may
profitably be set side by side. Here he dresses the
Christian soul in the robes of peace, bidding him
put on pity and meekness, and above all, the silken
girdle of love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;In peace, there&#8217;s nothing so becomes a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As modest stillness and humility;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the blast of war blows in our ears,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>then &ldquo;put on the whole armour of God,&rdquo; the
leathern girdle of truth, the shining breastplate of
righteousness, and above all, the shield of faith&mdash;and
so stand a flashing pillar of steel. Are the two
pictures inconsistent? must we doff the robes of
peace to don the armour, or put off the armour to
resume the robes of peace? Not so; both must
be worn together, for neither is found in its completeness
without the other. Beneath the armour
must be the fine linen, clean and white&mdash;and at one
and the same time, our souls may be clad in all pity,
mercifulness and love, and in all the sparkling
panoply of courage and strength for battle.</p>

<p>But both the armour and the dress of peace presuppose
that we have listened to Christ&#8217;s pleading
counsel to buy of Him &ldquo;white raiment that we may
be clothed, and that the shame of our nakedness
do not appear.&rdquo; The garment for the soul, which
is to hide its deformities and to replace our own
filthy rags, is woven in no earthly looms, and no
efforts of ours will bring us into possession of it.
We must be content to owe it wholly to Christ&#8217;s
gift, or else we shall have to go without it altogether.
The first step in the Christian life is by simple faith
to receive from Him the forgiveness of all our sins,
and that new nature which He alone can impart,
and which we can neither create nor win, but must
simply accept. Then, after that, come the field and
the time for efforts put forth in His strength, to
array our souls in His likeness, and day by day to
put on the beautiful garments which He bestows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
It is a lifelong work thus to strip ourselves of the
rags of our old vices, and to gird on the robe
of righteousness. Lofty encouragements, tender
motives, solemn warnings, all point to this as our
continual task. We should set ourselves to it in
His strength, if so be that being clothed, we may
not be found naked&mdash;and then, when we lay aside
the garment of flesh and the armour needed for the
battle, we shall hear His voice welcoming us to the
land of peace, and shall walk with Him in victor&#8217;s
robes, glistening &ldquo;so as no fuller on earth could
white them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are here three precepts somewhat loosely
connected, of which the first belongs properly to
the series considered in our last section, from which
it is only separated as not sharing in the metaphor
under which the virtues contained in the former
verses were set forth. In substance it is closely
connected with them, though in form it is different,
and in sweep is more comprehensive. The second
refers mainly to Christian intercourse, especially to
social worship; and the third covers the whole field
of conduct, and fitly closes the series, which in it
reaches the utmost possible generality, and from it
drops to the inculcation of very special domestic
duties. The three verses have each a dominant
phrase round which we may group their teaching.
These three are, the peace of Christ, the word of
Christ, the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
I. The Ruling Peace of Christ.</p>

<p>The various reading &ldquo;peace of Christ,&rdquo; for &ldquo;peace
of God,&rdquo; is not only recommended by manuscript
authority, but has the advantage of bringing the expression
into connection with the great words of the
Lord, &ldquo;Peace I leave with you, My peace I give
unto you.&rdquo; A strange legacy to leave, and a
strange moment at which to speak of His peace!
It was but an hour or so since He had been
&ldquo;troubled in spirit,&rdquo; as He thought of the betrayer&mdash;and
in an hour more He would be beneath the
olives of Gethsemane; and yet, even at such a time,
He bestows on His friends some share in His own
deep repose of spirit. Surely &ldquo;the peace of Christ&rdquo;
must mean what &ldquo;My peace&rdquo; meant; not only the
peace which He gives, but the peace which lay, like
a great calm on the sea, on His own deep heart;
and surely we cannot restrict so solemn an expression
to the meaning of mutual concord among
brethren. That, no doubt, is included in it, but
there is much more than that. Whatever made the
strange calm which leaves such unmistakable traces
in the picture of Christ drawn in the Gospels, may
be ours. When He gave us His peace, He gave us
some share in that meek submission of will to His
Father&#8217;s will, and in that stainless purity, which
were its chief elements. The hearts and lives of
men are made troubled, not by circumstances, but
by themselves. Whoever can keep his own will in
harmony with God&#8217;s enters into rest, though many
trials and sorrows may be his. Even if within and
without are fightings, there may be a central &ldquo;peace
subsisting at the heart of endless agitation.&rdquo; We
are our own disturbers. The eager swift motions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
our own wills keep us restless. Forsake these, and
quiet comes. Christ&#8217;s peace was the result of the
perfect harmony of all His nature. All was co-operant
to one great purpose; desires and passions
did not war with conscience and reason, nor did the
flesh lust against the Spirit. Though that complete
uniting of all our inner selves in the sweet concord
of perfect obedience is not attained on earth, yet its
beginnings are given to us by Christ, and in Him
we may be at peace with ourselves, and have one
great ruling power binding all our conflicting desires
in one, as the moon draws after her the heaped
waters of the sea.</p>

<p>We are summoned to improve that gift&mdash;to &ldquo;<i>let</i>
the peace of Christ&rdquo; have its way in our hearts. The
surest way to increase our possession of it is to
decrease our separation from Him. The fulness of
our possession of His gift of peace depends altogether
on our proximity to the Giver. It evaporates in
carrying. It &ldquo;diminishes as the square of the
distance&rdquo; from the source. So the exhortation to
let it rule in us will be best fulfilled by keeping
thought and affection in close union with our Lord.</p>

<p>This peace is to &ldquo;rule&rdquo; in our hearts. The
figure contained in the word here translated <i>rule</i> is
that of the umpire or arbitrator at the games, who,
looking down on the arena, watches that the combatants
strive lawfully, and adjudges the prize.
Possibly the force of the figure may have been
washed out of the word by use, and the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; of
our rendering may be all that it means. But there
seems no reason against keeping the full force of the
expression, which adds picturesqueness and point
to the precept. The peace of Christ, then, is to sit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
enthroned as umpire in the heart; or, if we might
give a mediæval instead of a classical shape to the
figure, that fair sovereign, Peace, is to be Queen of
the Tournament, and her &ldquo;eyes rain influence and
adjudge the prize.&rdquo; When contending impulses and
reasons distract and seem to pull us in opposite
directions, let her settle which is to prevail. How
can the peace of Christ do that for us? We may
make a rude test of good and evil by their effects on
our inward repose. Whatever mars our tranquillity,
ruffling the surface so that Christ&#8217;s image is no
longer visible, is to be avoided. That stillness of
spirit is very sensitive and shrinks away at the
presence of an evil thing. Let it be for us what
the barometer is to a sailor, and if it sinks, let us be
sure a storm is at hand. If we find that a given
course of action tends to break our peace, we may
be certain that there is poison in the draught which
as in the old stories, has been detected by the
shivered cup, and we should not drink any more.
There is nothing so precious that it is worth while to
lose the peace of Christ for the sake of it. Whenever
we find it in peril, we must retrace our steps.</p>

<p>Then follows appended a reason for cultivating
the peace of Christ &ldquo;to which also ye were called
in one body.&rdquo; The very purpose of God&#8217;s merciful
summons and invitation to them in the gospel was
that they might share in this peace. There are
many ways of putting God&#8217;s design in His call by
the gospel&mdash;it may be represented under many
angles and from many points of view, and is glorious
from all and each. No one word can state all the
fulness to which we are called by His wonderful
love, but none can be tenderer and more blessed than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
this thought, that God&#8217;s great voice has summoned
us to a share in Christ&#8217;s peace. Being so called, all
who share in it of course find themselves knit to
each other by possession of a common gift. What
a contradiction then, to be summoned in order to so
blessed a possession, and not to allow it sovereign
sway in moulding heart and life! What a contradiction,
further, to have been gathered into one body
by the common possession of the peace of Christ,
and yet not to allow it to bind all the members in
its sweet fetters with cords of love! The sway of
the &ldquo;peace of Christ&rdquo; in our hearts will ensure the
perfect exercise of all the other graces of which we
have been hearing, and therefore this precept fitly
closes the series of exhortations to brotherly affections,
and seals all with the thought of the &ldquo;one
body&rdquo; of which all these &ldquo;new men&rdquo; are members.</p>

<p>The very abruptness of the introduction of the
next precept gives it force, &ldquo;and be ye thankful,&rdquo; or,
as we might translate with an accuracy which perhaps
is not too minute, &ldquo;become thankful,&rdquo; striving
towards deeper gratitude than you have yet attained.
Paul is ever apt to catch fire as often as his thought
brings him in sight of God&#8217;s great love in drawing
men to Himself, and in giving them such rich gifts.
It is quite a feature of his style to break into sudden
bursts of praise as often as his path leads him to
a summit from which he catches a glimpse of that
great miracle of love. This interjected precept is
precisely like these sudden jets of praise. It is as
if he had broken off for a moment from the line
of his thought, and had said to his hearers&mdash;Think
of that wonderful love of your Father God. He has
called you from the midst of your heathenism, He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
has called you from a world of tumult and a life of
troubled unrest to possess the peace which brooded
ever, like the mystic dove, over Christ&#8217;s head; He
has called you in one body, having knit in a grand
unity us, Jews and Gentiles, so widely parted before.
Let us pause and lift up our voices in praise to Him.
True thankfulness will well up at all moments, and
will underlie and blend with all duties. There are
frequent injunctions to thankfulness in this letter,
and we have it again enjoined in the closing words
of the verses which we are now considering, so that
we may defer any further remarks till we come to
deal with these.</p>

<p>II. The Indwelling Word of Christ.</p>

<p>The main reference of this verse seems to be to
the worship of the Church&mdash;the highest expression
of its oneness. There are three points enforced in
its three clauses, of which the first is the dwelling
in the hearts of the Colossian Christians of the
&ldquo;word of Christ,&rdquo; by which is meant, as I conceive,
not simply &ldquo;the presence of Christ in the heart, as an inward
monitor,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
but the indwelling of the definite body of truths contained in the gospel which
had been preached to them. That gospel is the
word of Christ, inasmuch as He is its subject.
These early Christians received that body of truth
by oral teaching. To us it comes in the history of
Christ&#8217;s life and death, and in the exposition of the
significance and far-reaching depth and power of
these, which are contained in the rest of the New
Testament&mdash;a very definite body of teaching. How
can it abide in the heart? or what is the dwelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of that word within us but the occupation of mind
and heart and will with the truth concerning Jesus
revealed to us in Scripture? This indwelling is in
our own power, for it is matter of precept and not
of promise&mdash;and if we want to have it we must do
with religious truth just what we do with other truths
that we want to keep in our minds&mdash;ponder them,
use our faculties on them, be perpetually recurring
to them, fix them in our memories, like nails fastened
in a sure place, and, that we may remember them,
&ldquo;get them by heart,&rdquo; as the children say. Few
things are more wanting to-day than this. The
popular Christianity of the day is strong in philanthropic
service, and some phases of it are full of
&ldquo;evangelistic&rdquo; activity, but it is wofully lacking in
intelligent grasp of the great principles involved and
revealed in the gospel. Some Christians have yielded
to the popular prejudice against &ldquo;dogma,&rdquo; and have
come to dislike and neglect the doctrinal side of
religion, and others are so busy in good works of
various kinds that they have no time nor inclination
to reflect nor to learn, and for others &ldquo;the cares of
this world and the lusts of other things, entering in,
choke the word.&rdquo; A merely intellectual Christianity
is a very poor thing, no doubt; but that has been
dinned into our ears so long and loudly for a
generation now, that there is much need for a clear
preaching of the other side&mdash;namely, that a merely
emotional Christianity is a still poorer, and that if
feeling on the one hand and conduct on the other
are to be worthy of men with heads on their
shoulders and brains in their heads, both feeling and
conduct must be built on a foundation of truth
believed and pondered. In the ordered monarchy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of human nature, reason is meant to govern, but she
is also meant to submit, and for her the law holds
good, she must learn to obey that she may be able
to rule. She must bow to the word of Christ, and
then she will sway aright the kingdom of the soul.
It becomes us to make conscience of seeking to get
a firm and intelligent grasp of Christian truth as
a whole, and not to be always living on milk meant
for babes, nor to expect that teachers and preachers
should only repeat for ever the things which we
know already.</p>

<p>That word is to dwell in Christian men <i>richly</i>.
It is their own fault if they possess it, as so many
do, in scant measure. It might be a full tide.
Why in so many is it a mere trickle, like an
Australian river in the heat, a line of shallow ponds
with no life or motion, scarcely connected by a
thread of moisture, and surrounded by great stretches
of blinding shingle, when it might be a broad water&mdash;&ldquo;waters
to swim in&rdquo;? Why, but because they do
not do with this word, what all students do with the
studies which they love?</p>

<p>The word should manifest the rich abundance of
its dwelling in men by opening out in their minds
into &ldquo;every kind of wisdom.&rdquo; Where the gospel in
its power dwells in a man&#8217;s spirit, and is intelligently
meditated on and studied, it will effloresce into
principles of thought and action applicable to all
subjects, and touching the whole round horizon of
human life. All, and more than all, the wisdom
which these false teachers promised in their mysteries,
is given to the babes and the simple ones
who treasure the word of Christ in their hearts, and
the least among them may say, &ldquo;I have more understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
than all my teachers, for Thy testimonies
are my meditation.&rdquo; That gospel which the child
may receive, has &ldquo;infinite riches in a narrow room,&rdquo;
and, like some tiny black seed, for all its humble
form, has hidden in it the promise and potency of
wondrous beauty of flower, and nourishment of fruit.
Cultured and cared for in the heart where it is sown,
it will unfold into all truth which a man can receive
or God can give, concerning God and man, our
nature, duties, hopes and destinies, the tasks of the
moment, and the glories of eternity. He who has
it and lets it dwell richly in his heart is wise; he
who has it not, &ldquo;at his latter end shall be a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second clause of this verse deals with the
manifestations of the indwelling word in the worship
of the Church. The individual possession of the
word in one&#8217;s own heart does not make us independent
of brotherly help. Rather, it is the very
foundation of the duty of sharing our riches with
our fellows, and of increasing ours by contributions
from their stores. And so&mdash;&ldquo;teaching and admonishing
one another&rdquo; is the outcome of it. The
universal possession of Christ&#8217;s word involves the
equally universal right and duty of mutual instruction.</p>

<p>We have already heard the Apostle declaring it
to be his work to &ldquo;admonish every man and to
teach every man,&rdquo; and found that the former office
pointed to practical ethical instruction, not without
rebuke and warning, while the latter referred rather
to doctrinal teaching. What he there claimed for
himself, he here enjoins on the whole Christian
community. We have here a glimpse of the
perfectly simple, informal public services of the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Church, which seem to have partaken much more of
the nature of a free conference than of any of the
forms of worship at present in use in any Church.
The evidence both of this passage and of the other
Pauline Epistles, especially of the first Epistle to the
Corinthians (xiv.) unmistakably shows this. The
forms of worship in the apostolic Church are not
meant for models, and we do not prove a usage as
intended to be permanent because we prove it to be
primitive; but the principles which underlie the
usages are valid always and everywhere, and one of
these principles is the universal though not equal
inspiration of Christian men, which results in their
universal calling to teach and admonish. In what
forms that principle shall be expressed, how safeguarded
and controlled, is of secondary importance.
Different stages of culture and a hundred other
circumstances will modify these, and nobody but a
pedant or religious martinet will care about uniformity.
But I cannot but believe that the present
practice of confining the public teaching of the
Church to an official class has done harm. Why
should one man be for ever speaking, and hundreds
of people who are able to teach, sitting dumb to
listen or pretend to listen to him? Surely there is
a wasteful expenditure there. I hate forcible
revolution, and do not believe that any institutions,
either political or ecclesiastical, which need violence
to sweep them away, are ready to be removed; but
I believe that if the level of spiritual life were raised
among us, new forms would naturally be evolved,
in which there should be a more adequate recognition
of the great principle on which the democracy of
Christianity is founded, namely, &ldquo;I will pour out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
My Spirit on all flesh&mdash;and on My servants and on
My handmaidens I will pour out in these days of
My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.&rdquo; There are not
wanting signs that many different classes of Christian
worshippers have ceased to find edification in the
present manner of teaching. The more cultured
write books on &ldquo;the decay of preaching;&rdquo; the more
earnest take to mission halls and a &ldquo;freer service,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;lay preaching;&rdquo; the more indifferent stay at
home. When the tide rises, all the idle craft
stranded on the mud are set in motion; such a time
is surely coming for the Church, when the aspiration
that has waited millenniums for its fulfilment, and
received but a partial accomplishment at Pentecost,
shall at last be a fact: &ldquo;would God that all the
Lord&#8217;s people were prophets, and that the Lord
would put His Spirit upon them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The teaching and admonishing is here regarded as
being effected by means of song. That strikes one
as singular, and tempts to another punctuation of the
verse, by which &ldquo;In all wisdom teaching and admonishing
one another&rdquo; should make a separate clause,
and &ldquo;in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&rdquo;
should be attached to the following words. But
probably the ordinary arrangement of clauses is best
on the whole. The distinction between &ldquo;psalms&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hymns&rdquo; appears to be that the former is a
song with a musical accompaniment, and that the
latter is vocal praise to God. No doubt the &ldquo;psalms&rdquo;
meant were chiefly those of the Psalter, the Old
Testament element in the early Christian worship,
while the &ldquo;hymns&rdquo; were the new product of the
spirit of devotion which had naturally broken into
song, the first beginnings of the great treasure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Christian hymnody. &ldquo;Spiritual songs&rdquo; is a more
general expression, including all varieties of Christian
poesy, provided that they come from the Spirit
moving in the heart. We know from many sources
that song had a large part in the worship of the
early Church. Indeed, whenever a great quickening
of religious life comes, a great burst of Christian song
comes with it. The onward march of the Church
has ever been attended by music of praise; &ldquo;as well
the singers as the players on instruments&rdquo; have been
there. The mediæval Latin hymns cluster round
the early pure days of the monastic orders; Luther&#8217;s
rough stormy hymns were as powerful as his treatises;
the mystic tenderness and rapture of Charles
Wesley&#8217;s have become the possession of the whole
Church. We hear from outside observers, that one
of the practices of the early Christians which most
attracted heathen notice was, that they assembled
daily before it was light and &ldquo;sang hymns of praise
to one Christus as to a god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These early hymns were of a dogmatic character.
No doubt, just as in many a missionary Church a
hymn is found to be the best vehicle for conveying
the truth, so it was in these early Churches, which
were made up largely of slaves and women&mdash;both
uneducated. &ldquo;Singing the gospel&rdquo; is a very old
invention, though the name be new. The picture
which we get here of the meetings of the early
Christians is very remarkable. Evidently their
gatherings were free and social, with the minimum
of form, and that most elastic. If a man had any
word of exhortation for the people, he might say on.
&ldquo;Every one of you hath a psalm, a doctrine.&rdquo; If a
man had some fragment of an old psalm, or some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
strain that had come fresh from the Christian heart,
he might sing it, and his brethren would listen. We
do not have that sort of psalmody now. But what a
long way we have travelled from it to a modern congregation,
standing with books that they scarcely look
at, and &ldquo;worshipping&rdquo; in a hymn which half of them
do not open their mouths to sing at all, and the other
half do in a voice inaudible three pews off.</p>

<p>The best praise, however, is a heart song. So the
Apostle adds &ldquo;singing in your hearts unto God.&rdquo;
And it is to be in &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; that is to say, <i>in</i> it as the
atmosphere and element in which the song moves,
which is nearly equivalent to &ldquo;by means of the
Divine grace&rdquo; which works in the heart, and impels
to that perpetual music of silent praise. If we have
the peace of Christ in our hearts, and the word of
Christ dwelling in us richly in all wisdom, then an
unspoken and perpetual music will dwell there too,
&ldquo;a noise like of a hidden brook&rdquo; singing for ever its
&ldquo;quiet tune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The all-hallowing Name of Jesus.</p>

<p>From worship the Apostle passes to life, and
crowns the entire series of injunctions with an all-comprehensive
precept, covering the whole ground
of action. &ldquo;<i>Whatsoever</i> ye do, in word or deed&rdquo;&mdash;then,
not merely worship, specially so called, but
everything is to come under the influence of the same
motive. That expresses emphatically the sanctity of
common life, and extends the idea of worship to all
deeds. &ldquo;Whatsoever ye <i>do</i> in <i>word</i>&rdquo;&mdash;then words
are <i>doings</i>, and in many respects the most important
of our doings. Some words, though they fade off
the ear so quickly, outlast all contemporary deeds, and
are more lasting than brass. Not only &ldquo;the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of the Lord,&rdquo; but, in a very solemn sense, the word
of man &ldquo;endureth for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do all &ldquo;in the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; That
means at least two things&mdash;in obedience to His
authority, and in dependence on His help. These
two are the twin talismans which change the whole
character of our actions, and preserve us, in doing
them, from every harm. That name hallows and
ennobles all work. Nothing can be so small but
this will make it great, nor so monotonous and tame
but this will make it beautiful and fresh. The
name now, as of old, casts out devils and stills
storms. &ldquo;For the name of the Lord Jesus&rdquo; is the
silken padding which makes our yokes easy. It
brings the sudden strength which makes our burdens
light. We may write it over all our actions. If
there be any on which we dare not inscribe it, they
are not for us.</p>

<p>Thus done in the name of Christ, all deeds will
become thanksgiving, and so reach their highest
consecration and their truest blessedness. &ldquo;Giving
thanks to God the Father through Him&rdquo; is ever
to accompany the work in the name of Jesus. The
exhortation to thanksgiving, which is in a sense the
Alpha and the Omega of the Christian life, is perpetually
on the Apostle&#8217;s lips, because thankfulness
should be in perpetual operation in our hearts. It
is so important because it presupposes all-important
things, and because it certainly leads to every
Christian grace. For continual thankfulness there
must be a continual direction of mind towards God
and towards the great gifts of our salvation in Jesus
Christ. There must be a continual going forth of
our love and our desire to these, that is to say&mdash;thankfulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
rests on the reception and the joyful
appropriation of the mercies of God, brought to us
by our Lord. And it underlies all acceptable service
and all happy obedience. The servant who
thinks of God as a harsh exactor is slothful; the
servant who thinks of Him as the &ldquo;giving God&rdquo; rejoices
in toil. He who brings his work in order to
be paid for it, will get no wages, and turn out no
work worth any. He who brings it because he feels
that he has been paid plentiful wages beforehand, of
which he will never earn the least mite, will present
service well pleasing to the Master.</p>

<p>So we should keep thoughts of Jesus Christ, and
of all we owe to Him, ever before us in our common
work, in shop and mill and counting-house, in study
and street and home. We should try to bring all
our actions more under their influence, and, moved
by the mercies of God, should yield ourselves living
thank-offerings to Him, who is the sin-offering for
us. If, as every fresh duty arises, we hear Christ
saying, &ldquo;This do in remembrance of Me,&rdquo; all life
will become a true communion with Him, and every
common vessel will be as a sacramental chalice, and
the bells of the horses will bear the same inscription
as the high priest&#8217;s mitre&mdash;&ldquo;Holiness to the Lord.&rdquo;
To lay work on that altar sanctifies both the giver
and the gift. Presented through Him, by whom all
blessings come to man and all thanks go to God,
and kindled by the flame of gratitude, our poor
deeds, for all their grossness and earthliness, shall
go up in curling wreaths of incense, an odour of
a sweet smell acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>This section deals with the Christian family, as
made up of husband and wife, children, and
servants. In the family, Christianity has most
signally displayed its power of refining, ennobling,
and sanctifying earthly relationships. Indeed, one
may say that domestic life, as seen in thousands of
Christian homes, is purely a Christian creation, and
would have been a new revelation to the heathenism
of Colossæ, as it is to-day in many a mission field.</p>

<p>We do not know what may have led Paul to dwell
with special emphasis on the domestic duties, in this
letter, and in the contemporaneous Epistle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Ephesians. He does so, and the parallel section
there should be carefully compared throughout with
this paragraph. The former is considerably more
expanded, and may have been written after the
verses before us; but, however that may be, the
verbal coincidences and variations in the two
sections are very interesting as illustrations of the
way in which a mind fully charged with a theme
will freely repeat itself, and use the same words in
different combinations and with infinite shades of
modification.</p>

<p>The precepts given are extremely simple and
obvious. Domestic happiness and family Christianity
are made up of very homely elements. One duty is
prescribed for the one member of each of the three
family groups, and varying forms of another for the
other. The wife, the child, the servant are bid to
obey; the husband to love, the father to show his
love in gentle considerateness; the master to yield
his servants their dues. Like some perfume distilled
from common flowers that grow on every bank, the
domestic piety which makes home a house of God,
and a gate of heaven, is prepared from these two
simples&mdash;obedience and love. These are all.</p>

<p>We have here then the ideal Christian household
in the three ordinary relationships which make up
the family; wife and husband, children and father,
servant and master.</p>

<p>I. The Reciprocal Duties of wife and husband&mdash;subjection
and love.</p>

<p>The duty of the wife is &ldquo;subjection,&rdquo; and it is
enforced on the ground that it is &ldquo;fitting in the
Lord&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;it is,&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;it became&rdquo; at
the time of conversion, &ldquo;the conduct corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to or befitting the condition of being in the Lord.&rdquo;
In more modern language&mdash;the Christian ideal of
the wife&#8217;s duty has for its very centre&mdash;subjection.</p>

<p>Some of us will smile at that; some of us will
think it an old-fashioned notion, a survival of a more
barbarous theory of marriage than this century
recognises. But, before we decide upon the correctness
of the apostolic precept, let us make quite sure
of its meaning. Now, if we turn to the corresponding
passage in Ephesians, we find that marriage is
regarded from a high and sacred point of view, as
being an earthly shadow and faint adumbration of
the union between Christ and the Church.</p>

<p>To Paul, all human and earthly relationships were
moulded after the patterns of things in the heavens,
and the whole fleeting visible life of man was a
parable of the &ldquo;things which are&rdquo; in the spiritual
realm. Most chiefly, the holy and mysterious union
of man and woman in marriage is fashioned in the
likeness of the only union which is closer and more
mysterious than itself, namely that between Christ
and His Church.</p>

<p>Such then as are the nature and the spring of
the Church&#8217;s &ldquo;subjection&rdquo; to Christ, such will be the
nature and the spring of the wife&#8217;s &ldquo;subjection&rdquo; to
the husband. That is to say, it is a subjection of
which love is the very soul and animating principle.
In a true marriage, as in the loving obedience of a
believing soul to Christ, the wife submits not because
she has found a master, but because her heart has
found its rest. Everything harsh or degrading melts
away from the requirement when thus looked at.
It is a joy to serve where the heart is engaged, and
that is eminently true of the feminine nature. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
its full satisfaction, a woman&#8217;s heart needs to look
up where it loves. She has certainly the fullest
wedded life who can &ldquo;reverence&rdquo; her husband. For
its full satisfaction, a woman&#8217;s heart needs to serve
where it loves. That is the same as saying that a
woman&#8217;s love is, in the general, nobler, purer, more
unselfish than a man&#8217;s, and therein, quite as much
as in physical constitution, is laid the foundation of
that Divine ideal of marriage, which places the wife&#8217;s
delight and dignity in sweet loving subjection.</p>

<p>Of course the subjection has its limitations. &ldquo;We
must obey God rather than man&rdquo; bounds the field
of all human authority and control. Then there are
cases in which, on the principle of &ldquo;the tools to the
hands that can use them,&rdquo; the rule falls naturally to
the wife as the stronger character. Popular sarcasm,
however, shows that such instances are felt to be
contrary to the true ideal, and such a wife lacks
something of repose for her heart.</p>

<p>No doubt, too, since Paul wrote, and very largely
by Christian influences, women have been educated
and elevated, so as to make mere subjection impossible
now, if ever it were so. Woman&#8217;s quick
instinct as to persons, her finer wisdom, her purer
discernment as to moral questions, make it in a
thousand cases the wisest thing a man can do to
listen to the &ldquo;subtle flow of silver-paced counsel&rdquo;
which his wife gives him. All such considerations
are fully consistent with this apostolic teaching, and
it remains true that the wife who does not reverence
and lovingly obey is to be pitied if she cannot, and
to be condemned if she will not.</p>

<p>And what of the husband&#8217;s duty? He is to love,
and because he loves, not to be harsh or bitter, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
word, look or act. The parallel in Ephesians adds
the solemn elevating thought, that a man&#8217;s love to
the woman, whom he has made his own, is to be
like Christ&#8217;s to the Church. Patient and generous,
utterly self-forgetting and self-sacrificing, demanding
nothing, grudging nothing, giving all, not shrinking
from the extreme of suffering and pain and death
itself&mdash;that he may bless and help&mdash;such was the
Lord&#8217;s love to His bride, such is to be a Christian
husband&#8217;s love to his wife. That solemn example,
which lifts the whole emotion high above mere
passion or selfish affection, carries a great lesson too
as to the connection between man&#8217;s love and woman&#8217;s
&ldquo;subjection.&rdquo; The former is to evoke the latter,
just as in the heavenly pattern, Christ&#8217;s love melts
and moves human wills to glad obedience, which
is liberty. We do not say that a wife is utterly
absolved from obedience where a husband fails in
self-forgetting love, though certainly it does not lie
in <i>his</i> mouth to accuse, whose fault is graver than
and the origin of hers. But, without going so far
as that, we may recognise the true order to be that
the husband&#8217;s love, self-sacrificing and all-bestowing,
is meant to evoke the wife&#8217;s love, delighting in
service, and proud to crown him her king.</p>

<p>Where there is such love, there will be no question
of mere command and obedience, no tenacious adherence
to rights, or jealous defence of independence.
Law will be transformed into choice. To obey will
be joy; to serve, the natural expression of the heart.
Love uttering a wish speaks music to love listening;
and love obeying the wish is free and a queen.
Such sacred beauty may light up wedded life, if it
catches a gleam from the fountain of all light, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
shines by reflection from the love that binds Christ
to His Church as the links of the golden beams bind
the sun to the planet. Husbands and wives are to
see to it that this supreme consecration purifies and
raises their love. Young men and maidens are to
remember that the nobleness and heart-repose of their
whole life may be made or marred by marriage, and
to take heed where they fix their affections. If
there be not unity in the deepest thing of all, love
to Christ, the sacredness and completeness will fade
away from any love. But if a man and woman love
and marry &ldquo;in the Lord,&rdquo; He will be &ldquo;in the midst,&rdquo;
walking between them, a third who will make them
one, and that threefold cord will not be quickly
broken.</p>

<p>II. The Reciprocal Duties of children and parents&mdash;obedience
and gentle loving authority.</p>

<p>The injunction to children is laconic, decisive,
universal. &ldquo;Obey your parents in all things.&rdquo; Of
course, there is one limitation to that. If God&#8217;s
command looks one way, and a parent&#8217;s the opposite,
disobedience is duty&mdash;but such extreme case is
probably the only one which Christian ethics admit
as an exception to the rule. The Spartan brevity
of the command is enforced by one consideration,
&ldquo;for this is well-pleasing <i>in</i> the Lord,&rdquo; as the Revised
Version rightly reads, instead of &ldquo;to the Lord,&rdquo; as
in the Authorised, thus making an exact parallel
to the former &ldquo;fitting in the Lord.&rdquo; Not only to
Christ, but to all who can appreciate the beauty of
goodness, is filial obedience beautiful. The parallel
in Ephesians substitutes &ldquo;for this is right,&rdquo; appealing
to the natural conscience. Right and fair in itself,
it is accordant with the law stamped on the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
relationship, and it is witnessed as such by the
instinctive approbation which it evokes.</p>

<p>No doubt, the moral sentiment of Paul&#8217;s age
stretched parental authority to an extreme, and we
need not hesitate to admit that the Christian idea of
a father&#8217;s power and a child&#8217;s obedience has been
much softened by Christianity; but the softening has
come from the greater prominence given to love,
rather than from the limitation given to obedience.</p>

<p>Our present domestic life seems to me to stand
sorely in need of Paul&#8217;s injunction. One cannot but
see that there is great laxity in this matter in many
Christian households, in reaction perhaps from the
too great severity of past times. Many causes lead
to this unwholesome relaxation of parental authority.
In our great cities, especially among the commercial
classes, children are generally better educated than
their fathers and mothers, they know less of early
struggles, and one often sees a sense of inferiority
making a parent hesitate to command, as well as a
misplaced tenderness making him hesitate to forbid.
A very misplaced and cruel tenderness it is to say
&ldquo;would you like?&rdquo; when he ought to say &ldquo;I wish.&rdquo;
It is unkind to lay on young shoulders &ldquo;the weight
of too much liberty,&rdquo; and to introduce young hearts
too soon to the sad responsibility of choosing between
good and evil. It were better and more loving by
far to put off that day, and to let the children feel
that in the safe nest of home, their feeble and
ignorant goodness is sheltered behind a strong barrier
of command, and their lives simplified by having the
one duty of obedience. By many parents the advice
is needed&mdash;consult your children less, command them
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
And as for children, here is the one thing which
God would have them do: &ldquo;Obey your parents in
all things.&rdquo; As fathers used to say when I was a
boy&mdash;&ldquo;not only obedience, but prompt obedience.&rdquo;
It is right. That should be enough. But children
may also remember that it is &ldquo;pleasing&rdquo;&mdash;fair and
good to see, making them agreeable in the eyes of
all whose approbation is worth having, and pleasing
to themselves, saving them from many a bitter
thought in after days, when the grave has closed
over father and mother. One remembers the story
of how Dr. Johnson, when a man, stood in the
market place at Lichfield, bareheaded, with the rain
pouring on him, in remorseful remembrance of
boyish disobedience to his dead father. There is
nothing bitterer than the too late tears for wrongs
done to those who are gone beyond the reach of
our penitence. &ldquo;Children obey your parents in all
things,&rdquo; that you may be spared the sting of conscience
for childish faults, which may be set
tingling and smarting again even in old age.</p>

<p>The law for parents is addressed to &ldquo;fathers,&rdquo;
partly because a mother&#8217;s tenderness has less need
of the warning &ldquo;provoke not your children,&rdquo; than a
father&#8217;s more rigorous rule usually has, and partly
because the father is regarded as the head of the
household. The advice is full of practical sagacity.
How do parents provoke their children? By unreasonable
commands, by perpetual restrictions, by
capricious jerks at the bridle, alternating with as
capricious dropping of the reins altogether, by not
governing their own tempers, by shrill or stern tones
where quiet, soft ones would do, by frequent checks
and rebukes, and sparing praise. And what is sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to follow such mistreatment by father or mother?
First, as the parallel passage in Ephesians has it;
&ldquo;wrath&rdquo;&mdash;bursts of temper, for which probably the
child is punished and the parent is guilty&mdash;and then
spiritless listlessness and apathy. &ldquo;I cannot please
him whatever I do,&rdquo; leads to a rankling sense of
injustice, and then to recklessness&mdash;&ldquo;it is useless to
try any more.&rdquo; And when a child or a man loses
heart, there will be no more obedience. Paul&#8217;s
theory of the training of children is closely connected
with his central doctrine, that love is the life of
service, and faith the parent of righteousness. To
him hope and gladness and confident love underlie
all obedience. When a child loves and trusts, he
will obey. When he fears and has to think of his
father as capricious, exacting or stern, he will do
like the man in the parable, who was afraid because
he thought of his master as austere, reaping where
he did not sow, and therefore went and hid his
talent. Children&#8217;s obedience must be fed on love
and praise. Fear paralyses activity, and kills
service, whether it cowers in the heart of a boy to
his father, or of a man to his Father in heaven.</p>

<p>So parents are to let the sunshine of their smile
ripen their children&#8217;s love to fruit of obedience, and
remember that frost in spring scatters the blossoms
on the grass. Many a parent, especially many a
father, drives his child into evil by keeping him at a
distance. He should make his boy a companion
and playmate, teach him to think of his father as
his confidant, try to keep his child nearer to himself
than to anybody beside, and then his authority will
be absolute, his opinions an oracle, and his lightest
wish a law. Is not the kingdom of Jesus Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
based on His becoming a brother and one of ourselves,
and is it not wielded in gentleness and enforced
by love? Is it not the most absolute of
rules? and should not the parental authority be like
it&mdash;having a reed for a sceptre, lowliness and gentleness
being stronger to rule and to sway than the
&ldquo;rods of iron&rdquo; or of gold which earthly monarchs
wield?</p>

<p>There is added to this precept, in Ephesians, an
injunction on the positive side of parental duty:
&ldquo;Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord.&rdquo; I fear that is a duty fallen wofully into
disuse in many Christian households. Many parents
think it wise to send their children away from home
for their education, and so hand over their moral
and religious training to teachers. That may be
right, but it makes the fulfilment of this precept all
but impossible. Others, who have their children
beside them, are too busy all the week, and too fond
of &ldquo;rest&rdquo; on Sunday. Many send their children to
a Sunday school chiefly that they themselves may
have a quiet house and a sound sleep in the afternoon.
Every Christian minister, if he keeps his
eyes open, must see that there is no religious instruction
worth calling by the name in a very large
number of professedly Christian households; and he
is bound to press very earnestly on his hearers the
question, whether the Christian fathers and mothers
among them do their duty in this matter. Many of
them, I fear, have never opened their lips to their
children on religious subjects. Is it not a grief and
a shame that men and women with some religion in
them, and loving their little ones dearly, should be
tongue-tied before them on the most important of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
things? What can come of it but what does come of
it so often that it saddens one to see how frequently
it occurs&mdash;that the children drift away from a faith
which their parents did not care enough about to
teach it to them? A silent father makes prodigal
sons, and many a grey head has been brought down
with sorrow to the grave, and many a mother&#8217;s heart
broken, because he and she neglected their plain
duty, which can be handed over to no schools or
masters&mdash;the duty of religious instruction. &ldquo;These
words which I command thee, shall be in thine
heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently to thy
children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest
in thine house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The Reciprocal Duties of servants and masters&mdash;obedience
and justice.</p>

<p>The first thing to observe here is, that these
&ldquo;servants&rdquo; are slaves, not persons who have voluntarily
given their work for wages. The relation of
Christianity to slavery is too wide a subject to be
touched here. It must be enough to point out that
Paul recognises that &ldquo;sum of all villanies,&rdquo; gives instructions
to both parties in it, never says one word
in condemnation of it. More remarkable still; the
messenger who carried this letter to Colossæ carried
in the same bag the Epistle to Philemon, and was
accompanied by the fugitive slave Onesimus, on
whose neck Paul bound again the chain, so to
speak, with his own hands. And yet the gospel
which Paul preached has in it principles which cut
up slavery by the roots; as we read in this very
letter, &ldquo;In Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor
free.&rdquo; Why then did not Christ and His apostles
make war against slavery? For the same reason for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
which they did not make war against <i>any</i> political
or social institutions. &ldquo;First make the tree good
and his fruit good.&rdquo; The only way to reform
institutions is to elevate and quicken the general
conscience, and then the evil will be outgrown, left
behind, or thrown aside. Mould men and the men
will mould institutions. So Christianity did not
set itself to fell this upas tree, which would have
been a long and dangerous task; but girdled it, as
we may say, stripped the bark off it, and left it to
die&mdash;and it <i>has</i> died in all Christian lands now.</p>

<p>But the principles laid down here are quite as
applicable to our form of domestic and other service
as to the slaves and masters of Colossæ.</p>

<p>Note then the extent of the servant&#8217;s obedience&mdash;&ldquo;in
all things.&rdquo; Here, of course, as in former cases,
is there presupposed the limit of supreme obedience
to God&#8217;s commands; that being safe, all else is to
give way to the duty of submission. It is a stern
command, that seems all on the side of the masters.
It might strike a chill into many a slave, who had
been drawn to the gospel by the hope of finding
some little lightening of the yoke that pressed so
heavily on his poor galled neck, and of hearing some
voice speaking in tenderer tones than those of harsh
command. Still more emphatically, and, as it might
seem, still more harshly, the Apostle goes on to
insist on the inward completeness of the obedience&mdash;&ldquo;not
with eyeservice (a word of Paul&#8217;s own coining)
as men-pleasers.&rdquo; We have a proverb about the
worth of the master&#8217;s eye, which bears witness that
the same fault still clings to hired service. One has
only to look at the next set of bricklayers one sees
on a scaffold, or of haymakers one comes across in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
a field, to see it. The vice was venial in slaves;
it is inexcusable, because it darkens into theft, in
paid servants&mdash;and it spreads far and wide. All
scamped work, all productions of man&#8217;s hand or
brain which are got up to look better than they are,
all fussy parade of diligence when under inspection
and slackness afterwards&mdash;and all their like which
infect and infest every trade and profession, are
transfixed by the sharp point of this precept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in singleness of heart,&rdquo; that is, with undivided
motive, which is the antithesis and the
cure for &ldquo;eyeservice&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;fearing God,&rdquo; which
is opposed to &ldquo;pleasing men.&rdquo; Then follows the
positive injunction, covering the whole ground of
action and lifting the constrained obedience to the
earthly master up into the sacred and serene loftiness
of religious duty, &ldquo;whatsoever ye do, work
heartily,&rdquo; or from the soul. The word for <i>work</i> is
stronger than that for <i>do</i>, and implies effort and toil.
They are to put all their power into their work, and
not be afraid of hard toil. And they are not only
to bend their backs but their wills, and to labour
&ldquo;from the soul,&rdquo; that is, cheerfully and with interest&mdash;a
hard lesson for a slave and asking more than
could be expected from human nature, as many of
them would, no doubt, think. Paul goes on to
transfigure the squalor and misery of the slave&#8217;s lot
by a sudden beam of light&mdash;&ldquo;as to the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;your
true &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; for it is the same word as in
the previous verse&mdash;&ldquo;and not unto men.&rdquo; Do not
think of your tasks as only enjoined by harsh,
capricious, selfish men, but lift your thoughts to
Christ, who is your Lord, and glorify all these sordid
duties by seeing <i>His</i> will in them. He only who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
works as &ldquo;to the Lord,&rdquo; will work &ldquo;heartily.&rdquo; The
thought of Christ&#8217;s command, and of my poor toil
as done for His sake, will change constraint into
cheerfulness, and make unwelcome tasks pleasant,
and monotonous ones fresh, and trivial ones great.
It will evoke new powers, and renewed consecration.
In that atmosphere, the dim flame of servile obedience
will burn more brightly, as a lamp plunged
into a jar of pure oxygen.</p>

<p>The stimulus of a great hope for the ill-used, unpaid
slave, is added. Whatever their earthly masters
might fail to give them, the true Master whom they
really served would accept no work for which He
did not return more than sufficient wages. &ldquo;From
the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the
inheritance.&rdquo; Blows and scanty food and poor
lodging may be all that they get from their owners
for all their sweat and toil, but if they are Christ&#8217;s
slaves, they will be treated no more as slaves, but
as sons, and receive a son&#8217;s portion, the exact recompense
which consists of the &ldquo;inheritance.&rdquo; The
juxtaposition of the two ideas of the slave and the
inheritance evidently hints at the unspoken thought,
that they are heirs because they are sons&mdash;a thought
which might well lift up bowed backs and brighten
dull faces. The hope of that reward came like an
angel into the smoky huts and hopeless lives of
these poor slaves. It shone athwart all the gloom
and squalor, and taught patience beneath &ldquo;the
oppressor&#8217;s wrong, the proud man&#8217;s contumely.&rdquo;
Through long, weary generations it has lived in
the hearts of men driven to God by man&#8217;s tyranny,
and forced to clutch at heaven&#8217;s brightness to keep
them from being made mad by earth&#8217;s blackness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
It may irradiate our poor lives, especially when we
fail, as we all do sometimes, to get recognition of
our work, or fruit from it. If we labour for man&#8217;s
appreciation or gratitude, we shall certainly be disappointed;
but if for Christ, we have abundant
wages beforehand, and we shall have an overabundant
requital, the munificence of which will
make us more ashamed of our unworthy service
than anything else could do. Christ remains in no
man&#8217;s debt. &ldquo;Who hath first given, and it shall be
recompensed to him again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last word to the slave is a warning against
neglect of duty. There is to be a double recompense&mdash;to
the slave of Christ the portion of a son;
to the wrong doer retribution &ldquo;for the wrong that
he has done.&rdquo; Then, though slavery was itself a
wrong, though the master who held a man in bondage
was himself inflicting the greatest of all wrongs, yet
Paul will have the slave think that he still has duties
to his master. That is part of Paul&#8217;s general position
as to slavery. He will not wage war against it, but
for the present accept it. Whether he saw the full
bearing of the gospel on that and other infamous
institutions may be questioned. He has given us
the principles which will destroy them, but he is no
revolutionist, and so his present counsel is to remember
the master&#8217;s rights, even though they be
founded on wrong, and he has no hesitation in condemning
and predicting retribution for evil things
done by a slave to his master. A superior&#8217;s injustice
does not warrant an inferior&#8217;s breach of moral law,
though it may excuse it. Two blacks do not make
a white. Herein lies the condemnation of all the
crimes which enslaved nations and classes have done,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of many a deed which has been honoured and sung,
of the sanguinary cruelties of servile revolts, as well
as of the questionable means to which labour often
resorts in modern industrial warfare. The homely,
plain principle, that a man does not receive the right
to break God&#8217;s laws because he is ill-treated, would
clear away much fog from some people&#8217;s notions
of how to advance the cause of the oppressed.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, this warning may look
towards the masters also; and probably the same
double reference is also to be discerned in the closing
words to the slaves, &ldquo;and there is no respect of
persons.&rdquo; The servants were naturally tempted to
think that God was on their side, as indeed He was,
but also to think that the great coming day of judgment
was mostly meant to be terrible to tyrants and
oppressors, and so to look forward to it with a fierce
un-Christian joy, as well as with a false confidence
built only on their present misery. They would
be apt to think that God did &ldquo;respect persons,&rdquo; in
the opposite fashion from that of a partial judge&mdash;namely,
that He would incline the scale in favour
of the ill-used, the poor, the down-trodden; that
they would have an easy test and a light sentence,
while His frowns and His severity would be kept for
the powerful and the rich who had ground the faces
of the poor and kept back the hire of the labourer.
It was therefore a needful reminder for them, and
for us all, that that judgment has nothing to do
with earthly conditions, but only with conduct and
character; that sorrow and calamity here do not
open heaven&#8217;s gates hereafter, and that the slave and
master are tried by the same law.</p>

<p>The series of precepts closes with a brief but most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
pregnant word to masters. They are bid to give to
their slaves &ldquo;that which is just and equal,&rdquo; that is to
say, &ldquo;equitable.&rdquo; A startling criterion for a master&#8217;s
duty to the slave who was denied to have any rights
at all. They were chattels, not persons. A master
might, in regard to them, do what he liked with his
own; he might crucify or torture, or commit any
crime against manhood either in body or soul, and
no voice would question or forbid. How astonished
Roman lawgivers would have been if they could
have heard Paul talking about justice and equity
as applied to a slave! What a strange new dialect
it must have sounded to the slave-owners in the
Colossian Church! They would not see how far the
principle, thus quietly introduced, was to carry succeeding
ages; they could not dream of the great
tree that was to spring from this tiny seed-precept;
but no doubt the instinct which seldom fails an unjustly
privileged class, would make them blindly dislike
the exhortation, and feel as if they were getting
out of their depth when they were bid to consider
what was &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; in their dealings
with their slaves.</p>

<p>The Apostle does not define what <i>is</i> &ldquo;right and
equal.&rdquo; That will come. The main thing is to
drive home the conviction that there are duties
owing to slaves, inferiors, employés. We are far
enough from a satisfactory discharge of these yet;
but, at any rate, everybody now admits the principle&mdash;and
we have mainly to thank Christianity for
that. Slowly the general conscience is coming to
recognise that simple truth more and more clearly,
and its application is becoming more decisive with
each generation. There is much to be done before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
society is organized on that principle, but the time
is coming&mdash;and till it is come, there will be no
peace. All masters and employers of labour, in
their mills and warehouses, are bid to base their
relations to &ldquo;hands&rdquo; and servants on the one firm
foundation of &ldquo;justice.&rdquo; Paul does not say, Give
your servants what is kind and patronising. He
wants a great deal more than that. Charity likes to
come in and supply the wants which would never
have been felt had there been equity. An ounce of
justice is sometimes worth a ton of charity.</p>

<p>This duty of the masters is enforced by the same
thought which was to stimulate the servants to
their tasks: &ldquo;ye also have a Master in heaven.&rdquo;
That is not only stimulus, but it is pattern. I said
that Paul did not specify what was just and right,
and that his precept might therefore be objected to
as vague. Does the introduction of this thought of
the master&#8217;s Master in heaven, take away any of the
vagueness? If Christ is our Master, then we are to
look to Him to see what a master ought to be, and
to try to be masters like that. That is precise
enough, is it not? That grips tight enough, does it
not? Give your servants what you expect and
need to get from Christ. If we try to live that
commandment for twenty-four hours, it will probably
not be its vagueness of which we complain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have a Master in heaven&rdquo; is the great principle
on which all Christian duty reposes. Christ&#8217;s
command is my law, His will is supreme, His
authority absolute, His example all-sufficient. My
soul, my life, my all are His. My will is not my
own. My possessions are not my own. My being
is not my own. All duty is elevated into obedience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
to Him, and obedience to Him, utter and absolute,
is dignity and freedom. We are Christ&#8217;s slaves, for
He has bought us for Himself, by giving Himself
for us. Let that great sacrifice win our heart&#8217;s love
and our perfect submission. &ldquo;O Lord, truly I am
Thy servant, Thou hast loosed my bonds.&rdquo; Then
all earthly relationships will be fulfilled by us; and
we shall move among men, breathing blessing and
raying out brightness, when in all, we remember
that we have a Master in heaven, and do all our
work from the soul as to Him and not to men.</p>

<span class="titlesmaller"><i>PRECEPTS FOR THE INNERMOST AND OUTERMOST
LIFE.</i></span></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the
word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. Walk in wisdom
toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be
always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought
to answer each one.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iv. 2&ndash;6 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>So ends the ethical portion of the Epistle. A
glance over the series of practical exhortations,
from the beginning of the preceding chapter onwards,
will show that, in general terms we may say
that they deal successively with a Christian&#8217;s duties
to himself, the Church, and the family. And now,
these last advices touch the two extremes of life,
the first of them having reference to the hidden life
of prayer, and the second and third to the outward,
busy life of the market-place and the street. That
bringing together of the extremes seems to be the
link of connection here. The Christian life is first
regarded as gathered into itself&mdash;coiled as it were
on its centre, like some strong spring. Next, it is
regarded as it operates in the world, and, like the
uncoiling spring, gives motion to wheels and pinions.
These two sides of experience and duty are often
hard to blend harmoniously. The conflict between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
busy Martha, who serves, and quiet Mary, who only
sits and gazes, goes on in every age and in every
heart. Here we may find, in some measure, the
principle of reconciliation between their antagonistic
claims. Here is, at all events, the protest against
allowing either to oust the other. Continual prayer
is to blend with unwearied action. We are so to
walk the dusty ways of life as to be ever in the
secret place of the Most High. &ldquo;Continue stedfastly
in prayer,&rdquo; and withal let there be no unwholesome
withdrawal from the duties and relationships of the
outer world, but let the prayer pass into, first, a wise
walk, and second, an ever-gracious speech.</p>

<p>I. So we have here, first, an exhortation to a
hidden life of constant prayer.</p>

<p>The word rendered &ldquo;continue&rdquo; in the Authorised
Version, and more fully in the Revised Version by
&ldquo;continue stedfastly,&rdquo; is frequently found in reference
to prayer, as well as in other connections. A mere
enumeration of some of these instances may help to
illustrate its full meaning. &ldquo;We <i>will give ourselves</i>
to prayer,&rdquo; said the apostles in proposing the creation
of the office of deacon. &ldquo;<i>Continuing instant</i> in
prayer&rdquo; says Paul to the Roman Church. &ldquo;They
<i>continuing</i> daily with one accord in the Temple&rdquo; is
the description of the early believers after Pentecost.
Simon Magus is said to have &ldquo;continued with
Philip,&rdquo; where there is evidently the idea of close
adherence as well as of uninterrupted companionship.
These examples seem to show that the word implies
both earnestness and continuity; so that this injunction
not only covers the ground of Paul&#8217;s other
exhortation, &ldquo;Pray without ceasing,&rdquo; but includes
fervour also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
The Christian life, then, ought to be one of unbroken
prayer.</p>

<p>What manner of prayer can that be which is to
be continuous through a life that must needs be full
of toil on outward things? How can such a precept
be obeyed? Surely there is no need for paring down
its comprehensiveness, and saying that it merely
means&mdash;a very frequent recurrence to devout exercises,
as often as the pressure of daily duties will
permit. That is not the direction in which the
harmonising of such a precept with the obvious
necessities of our position is to be sought. We
must seek it in a more inward and spiritual notion
of prayer. We must separate between the form and
the substance, the treasure and the earthen vessel
which carries it. What is prayer? Not the utterance
of words&mdash;they are but the vehicle; but the
attitude of the spirit. Communion, aspiration, and
submission, these three are the elements of prayer&mdash;and
these three may be diffused through a life.
It is possible, though difficult. There may be unbroken
communion, a constant consciousness of God&#8217;s
presence, and of our contact with Him, thrilling
through our souls and freshening them, like some
breath of spring reaching the toilers in choky factories
and busy streets; or even if the communion do not
run like an absolutely unbroken line of light through
our lives, the points may be so near together as all
but to touch. In such communion words are needless.
When spirits draw closest together there is no
need for speech. Silently the heart may be kept
fragrant with God&#8217;s felt presence, and sunny with
the light of His face. There are towns nestling
beneath the Alps, every narrow filthy alley of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
looks to the great solemn snow-peaks, and the inhabitants,
amid all the squalor of their surroundings,
have that apocalypse of wonder ever before them, if
they would only lift their eyes. So we, if we will,
may live with the majesties and beauties of the
great white throne and of Him that sat on it closing
every vista and filling the end of every commonplace
passage in our lives.</p>

<p>In like manner, there may be a continual, unspoken
and unbroken presence of the second element
of prayer, which is aspiration, or desire after God.
All circumstances, whether duty, sorrow or joy,
should and may be used to stamp more deeply on
my consciousness the sense of my weakness and
need; and every moment, with its experience of
God&#8217;s swift and punctual grace, and all my communion
with Him which unveils to me His beauty&mdash;should
combine to move longings for Him, for
more of Him. The very deepest cry of the heart
which understands its own yearnings, is for the
living God; and perpetual as the hunger of the
spirit for the food which will stay its profound
desires, will be the prayer, though it may often be
voiceless, of the soul which knows where alone that
food is.</p>

<p>Continual too may be our submission to His will,
which is an essential of all prayer. Many people&#8217;s
notion is that our prayer is urging our wishes on
God, and that His answer is giving us what we
desire. But true prayer is the meeting in harmony
of God&#8217;s will and man&#8217;s, and its deepest expression
is not, Do this, because I desire it, O Lord; but, I
do this because Thou desirest it, O Lord. That
submission may be the very spring of all life, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
whatsoever work is done in such spirit, however
&ldquo;secular&rdquo; and however small it be, were it making
buttons, is truly prayer.</p>

<p>So there should run all through our lives the
music of that continual prayer, heard beneath all
our varying occupations like some prolonged deep
bass note, that bears up and gives dignity to the
lighter melody that rises and falls and changes
above it, like the spray on the crest of a great wave.
Our lives will then be noble and grave, and woven
into a harmonious unity, when they are based upon
continual communion with, continual desire after,
and continual submission to, God. If they are not,
they will be worth nothing and will come to nothing.</p>

<p>But such continuity of prayer is not to be attained
without effort; therefore Paul goes on to say,
&ldquo;Watching therein.&rdquo; We are apt to do drowsily
whatever we do constantly. Men fall asleep at any
continuous work. There is also the constant influence
of externals, drawing our thoughts away
from their true home in God, so that if we are to
keep up continuous devotion, we shall have to rouse
ourselves often when in the very act of dropping off
to sleep. &ldquo;Awake up, my glory!&rdquo; we shall often
have to say to our souls. Do we not all know that
subtly approaching languor? and have we not often
caught ourselves in the very act of falling asleep at
our prayers? We must make distinct and resolute
efforts to rouse ourselves&mdash;we must concentrate our
attention and apply the needed stimulants, and
bring the interest and activity of our whole nature
to bear on this work of continual prayer, else it will
become drowsy mumbling as of a man but half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
awake. The world has strong opiates for the soul,
and we must stedfastly resist their influence, if we
are to &ldquo;continue in prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One way of so watching is to have and to observe
definite times of spoken prayer. We hear much
now-a-days about the small value of times and forms
of prayer, and how, as I have been saying, true
prayer is independent of these, and needs no words.
All that, of course, is true; but when the practical
conclusion is drawn that therefore we can do without
the outward form, a grave mistake, full of mischief,
is committed. I do not, for my part, believe in a
devotion diffused through a life and never concentrated
and coming to the surface in visible outward
acts or audible words; and, as far as I have seen,
the men whose religion is spread all through their
lives most really are the men who keep the central
reservoir full, if I may so say, by regular and frequent
hours and words of prayer. The Christ, whose whole
life was devotion and communion with the Father,
had His nights on the mountains, and rising up a
great while before day, He watched unto prayer.
We must do the like.</p>

<p>One more word has still to be said. This continual
prayer is to be &ldquo;with thanksgiving&rdquo;&mdash;again
the injunction so frequent in this letter, in such
various connections. Every prayer should be blended
with gratitude, without the perfume of which, the
incense of devotion lacks one element of fragrance.
The sense of need, or the consciousness of sin, may
evoke &ldquo;strong crying and tears,&rdquo; but the completest
prayer rises confident from a grateful heart, which
weaves memory into hope, and asks much because
it has received much. A true recognition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
lovingkindness of the past has much to do with
making our communion sweet, our desires believing,
our submission cheerful. Thankfulness is the feather
that wings the arrow of prayer&mdash;the height from
which our souls rise most easily to the sky.</p>

<p>And now the Apostle&#8217;s tone softens from exhortation
to entreaty, and with very sweet and touching
humility he begs a supplemental corner in their
prayers. &ldquo;Withal praying also for us.&rdquo; The &ldquo;withal&rdquo;
and &ldquo;also&rdquo; have a tone of lowliness in them, while
the &ldquo;us,&rdquo; including as it does Timothy, who is
associated with him in the superscription of the
letter, and possibly others also, increases the impression
of modesty. The subject of their prayers
for Paul and the others is to be that &ldquo;God may
open unto us a door for the word.&rdquo; That phrase
apparently means an unhindered opportunity of
preaching the gospel, for the consequence of the
door&#8217;s being opened is added&mdash;&ldquo;to speak (so that
I may speak) the mystery of Christ.&rdquo; The special
reason for this prayer is, &ldquo;for which I am also (in
addition to my other sufferings) in bonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a prisoner. He cared little about that or
about the fetters on his wrists, so far as his own
comfort was concerned; but his spirit chafed at the
restraint laid upon him in spreading the good news
of Christ, though he had been able to do much in
his prison, both among the Prætorian guard, and
throughout the whole population of Rome. Therefore
he would engage his friends to ask God to open
the prison doors, as He had done for Peter, not that
Paul might come out, but that the gospel might.
The personal was swallowed up; all that he cared
for was to do his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
But he wants their prayers for more than that&mdash;&ldquo;that
I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.&rdquo;
This is probably explained most naturally as meaning
his endowment with power to set forth the message
in a manner adequate to its greatness. When he
thought of what it was that he, unworthy, had to
preach, its majesty and wonderfulness brought a kind
of awe over his spirit; and endowed, as he was, with
apostolic functions and apostolic grace; conscious,
as he was, of being anointed and inspired by God, he
yet felt that the richness of the treasure made the
earthen vessel seem terribly unworthy to bear it. His
utterances seemed to himself poor and unmelodious
beside the majestic harmonies of the gospel. He
could not soften his voice to breathe tenderly enough
a message of such love, nor give it strength enough
to peal forth a message of such tremendous import
and world-wide destination.</p>

<p>If Paul felt his conception of the greatness of the
gospel dwarfing into nothing <i>his</i> words when he tried
to preach it, what must every other true minister of
Christ feel? If he, in the fulness of his inspiration,
besought a place in his brethren&#8217;s prayers, how much
more must they need it, who try with stammering
tongues to preach the truth that made his fiery
words seem ice? Every such man must turn to
those who love him and listen to his poor presentment
of the riches of Christ, with Paul&#8217;s entreaty.
His friends cannot do a kinder thing to him than
to bear him on their hearts in their prayers to
God.</p>

<p>II. We have here next, a couple of precepts,
which spring at a bound from the inmost secret
of the Christian life to its circumference, and refer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to the outward life in regard to the non-Christian
world, enjoining, in view of it, a wise walk and
gracious speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk in wisdom towards them that are without.&rdquo;
Those that are within are those who have &ldquo;fled for
refuge&rdquo; to Christ, and are within the fold, the fortress,
the ark. Men who sit safe within while the storm
howls, may simply think with selfish complacency of
the poor wretches exposed to its fierceness. The
phrase may express spiritual pride and even contempt.
All close corporations tend to generate
dislike and scorn of outsiders, and the Church has
had its own share of such feeling; but there is no
trace of anything of the sort here. Rather is there
pathos and pity in the word, and a recognition that
their sad condition gives these outsiders a claim on
Christian men, who are bound to go out to their
help and bring them in. Precisely because they are
&ldquo;without&rdquo; do those within owe them a wise walk,
that &ldquo;if any will not hear the word, they may without
the word be won.&rdquo; The thought is in some
measure parallel to our Lord&#8217;s words, of which
perhaps it is a reminiscence. &ldquo;Behold I send you
forth&rdquo;&mdash;a strange thing for a careful shepherd to
do&mdash;&ldquo;as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore
wise as serpents.&rdquo; Think of that picture&mdash;the
handful of cowering frightened creatures huddled
against each other, and ringed round by that yelping,
white-toothed crowd, ready to tear them to pieces!
So are Christ&#8217;s followers in the world. Of course,
things have changed in many respects since those
days; partly because persecution has gone out of
fashion, and partly because &ldquo;the world&rdquo; has been
largely influenced by Christian morality, and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
because the Church has been largely secularized.
The temperature of the two has become nearly
equalized over a large tract of professing Christendom.
So a tolerably good understanding and a brisk trade
has sprung up between the sheep and the wolves.
But for all that, there is fundamental discord, however
changed may be its exhibition, and if we are
true to our Master and insist on shaping our lives
by His rules, we shall find out that there is.</p>

<p>We need, therefore, to &ldquo;walk in wisdom&rdquo; towards
the non-Christian world; that is, to let practical
prudence shape all our conduct. If we are Christians,
we have to live under the eyes of vigilant and
not altogether friendly observers, who derive satisfaction
and harm from any inconsistency of ours. A
plainly Christian life that needs no commentary to
exhibit its harmony with Christ&#8217;s commandments is
the first duty we owe to them.</p>

<p>And the wisdom which is to mould our lives in
view of these outsiders will &ldquo;discern both time and
judgment,&rdquo; will try to take the measure of men
and act accordingly. Common sense and practical
sagacity are important accompaniments of Christian
zeal. What a singularly complex character, in this
respect, was Paul&#8217;s&mdash;enthusiastic and yet capable
of such diplomatic adaptation; and withal never
dropping to cunning, nor sacrificing truth! Enthusiasts
who despise worldly wisdom, and therefore
often dash themselves against stone walls, are not
rare; cool calculators who abhor all generous glow
of feeling and have ever a pailful of cold water for
any project which shows it, are only too common&mdash;but
fire and ice together, like a volcano with glaciers
streaming down its cone, are rare. Fervour married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
to tact, common sense which keeps close to earth
and enthusiasm which flames heaven high, are a
rare combination. It is not often that the same
voice can say, &ldquo;I count not my life dear to myself,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I became all things to all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dangerous principle that last, a very slippery
piece of ground to get upon!&mdash;say people, and
quite truly. It <i>is</i> dangerous, and one thing only
will keep a man&#8217;s feet when on it, and that is, that
his wise adaptation shall be perfectly unselfish, and
that he shall ever keep clear before him the great
object to be gained, which is nothing personal, but
&ldquo;that I might by all means save some.&rdquo; If that
end is held in view, we shall be saved from the
temptation of hiding or maiming the very truth
which we desire should be received, and our wise
adaptation of ourselves and of our message to the
needs and weaknesses and peculiarities of those
&ldquo;who are without,&rdquo; will not degenerate into handling
the word of God deceitfully. Paul advised &ldquo;walking
in wisdom;&rdquo; he abhorred &ldquo;walking in craftiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We owe them that are without such a walk as
may tend to bring them in. Our life is to a large
extent their Bible. They know a great deal more
about Christianity, as they see it in us, than as it is
revealed in Christ, or recorded in Scripture&mdash;and if,
as seen in us, it does not strike them as very attractive,
small wonder if they still prefer to remain
where they are. Let us take care lest instead of
being doorkeepers to the house of the Lord, to
beckon passers-by and draw them in, we block
the doorway, and keep them from seeing the wonders
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
The Apostle adds a special way in which this
wisdom shows itself&mdash;namely, &ldquo;redeeming the time.&rdquo;
The last word here does not denote time in general,
but a definite season, or <i>opportunity</i>. The lesson,
then, is not that of making the best use of all the
moments as they fly, precious as that lesson is, but
that of discerning and eagerly using appropriate
opportunities for Christian service. The figure is
simple enough; to &ldquo;buy up&rdquo; means to make one&#8217;s
own. &ldquo;Make much of time, let not advantage slip,&rdquo;
is an advice in exactly the same spirit. Two things
are included in it; the watchful study of characters,
so as to know the right times to bring influences to
bear on them, and an earnest diligence in utilizing
these for the highest purposes. We have not acted
wisely towards those who are without unless we have
used every opportunity to draw them in.</p>

<p>But besides a wise walk, there is to be &ldquo;gracious
speech.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace.&rdquo;
A similar juxtaposition of &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;grace&rdquo;
occurred in chapter iii. 16. &ldquo;Let the word of
Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ... singing
with grace in your hearts&rdquo;; and there as here,
&ldquo;grace&rdquo; may be taken either in its lower æsthetic
sense, or in its higher spiritual. It may mean either
favour, agreeableness, or the Divine gift, bestowed
by the indwelling Spirit. The former is supposed
by many good expositors to be the meaning here.
But is it a Christian&#8217;s duty to make his speech
always agreeable? Sometimes it is his plain duty
to make it very disagreeable indeed. If our speech
is to be true, and wholesome, it must sometimes
rasp and go against the grain. Its pleasantness
depends on the inclinations of the hearers rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
than on the will of the honest speaker. If he is to
&ldquo;redeem the time&rdquo; and &ldquo;walk wisely to them that
are without,&rdquo; his speech cannot be always with such
grace. The advice to make our words always
pleasing may be a very good maxim for worldly
success, but it smacks of Chesterfield&#8217;s Letters
rather than of Paul&#8217;s Epistles.</p>

<p>We must go much deeper for the true import of
this exhortation. It is substantially this&mdash;whether
you can speak smooth things or no, and whether
your talk is always directly religious or no&mdash;and it
need not and cannot always be that&mdash;let there ever
be in it the manifest influence of God&#8217;s Spirit, Who
dwells in the Christian heart, and will mould and
sanctify your speech. Of you, as of your Master,
let it be true, &ldquo;Grace is poured into thy lips.&rdquo; He
in whose spirit the Divine Spirit abides will be
truly &ldquo;Golden-mouthed&rdquo;; his speech shall distil as
the dew, and whether his grave and lofty words
please frivolous and prurient ears or no, they will be
beautiful in the truest sense, and show the Divine
life pulsing through them, as some transparent skin
shows the throbbing of the blue veins. Men who
feed their souls on great authors catch their style,
as some of our great living orators, who are eager
students of English poetry. So if we converse
much with God, listening to His voice in our hearts,
our speech will have in it a tone that will echo that
deep music. Our accent will betray our country.
Then our speech will be with grace in the lower
sense of pleasingness. The truest gracefulness, both
of words and conduct, comes from heavenly grace.
The beauty caught from God, the fountain of all
things lovely, is the highest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
The speech is to be &ldquo;seasoned with salt.&rdquo; That
does not mean the &ldquo;Attic salt&rdquo; of wit. There is
nothing more wearisome than the talk of men who
are always trying to be piquant and brilliant. Such
speech is like a &ldquo;pillar of salt&rdquo;&mdash;it sparkles, but is
cold, and has points that wound, and it tastes bitter.
That is not what Paul recommends. Salt was used
in sacrifice&mdash;let the sacrificial salt be applied to all
our words; that is, let all we say be offered up
to God, &ldquo;a sacrifice of praise to God continually.&rdquo;
Salt preserves. Put into your speech what will keep
it from rotting, or, as the parallel passage in Ephesians
has it, &ldquo;let no <i>corrupt</i> communication proceed
out of your mouth.&rdquo; Frivolous talk, dreary gossip,
ill-natured talk, idle talk, to say nothing of foul and
wicked words, will be silenced when your speech is
seasoned with salt.</p>

<p>The following words make it probable that salt
here is used also with some allusion to its power of
giving savour to food. Do not deal in insipid
generalities, but suit your words to your hearers,
&ldquo;that ye may know how ye ought to answer each
one.&rdquo; Speech that fits close to the characteristics
and wants of the people to whom it is spoken is
sure to be interesting, and that which does not will
for them be insipid. Commonplaces that hit full
against the hearer will be no commonplaces to him,
and the most brilliant words that do not meet his
mind or needs will to him be tasteless &ldquo;as the white
of an egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Individual peculiarities, then, must determine the
wise way of approach to each man, and there will be
wide variety in the methods. Paul&#8217;s language to
the wild hill tribes of Lycaonia was not the same as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to the cultivated, curious crowd on Mars&#8217; Hill, and
his sermons in the synagogues have a different tone
from his reasonings of judgment to come before
Felix.</p>

<p>All that is too plain to need illustration. But
one word may be added. The Apostle here regards
it as the task of every Christian man to speak for
Christ. Further, he recommends dealing with individuals
rather than masses, as being within the
scope of each Christian, and as being much more
efficacious. Salt has to be rubbed in, if it is to do
any good. It is better for most of us to fish with
the rod than with the net, to angle for single souls,
rather than to try and enclose a multitude at once.
Preaching to a congregation has its own place and
value; but private and personal talk, honestly and
wisely done, will effect more than the most eloquent
preaching. Better to drill in the seeds, dropping
them one by one into the little pits made for their
reception, than to sow them broadcast.</p>

<p>And what shall we say of Christian men and
women, who can talk animatedly and interestingly
of anything but of their Saviour and His kingdom?
Timidity, misplaced reverence, a dread of seeming
to be self-righteous, a regard for conventional proprieties,
and the national reserve account for much
of the lamentable fact that there are so many such.
But all these barriers would be floated away like
straws, if a great stream of Christian feeling were
pouring from the heart. What fills the heart will
overflow by the floodgates of speech. So that the
real reason for the unbroken silence in which many
Christian people conceal their faith is mainly the
small quantity of it which there is to conceal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
A solemn ideal is set before us in these parting
injunctions&mdash;a higher righteousness than was
thundered from Sinai. When we think of our
hurried, formal devotion, our prayers forced from us
sometimes by the pressure of calamity, and so often
suspended when the weight is lifted; of the occasional
glimpses that we get of God&mdash;as sailors may
catch sight of a guiding star for a moment through
driving fog, and of the long tracts of life which
would be precisely the same, as far as our thoughts
are concerned, if there were no God at all, or He
had nothing to do with us&mdash;what an awful command
that seems, &ldquo;Continue stedfastly in prayer&rdquo;!</p>

<p>When we think of our selfish disregard of the
woes and dangers of the poor wanderers without,
exposed to the storm, while we think ourselves safe
in the fold, and of how little we have meditated on
and still less discharged our obligations to them,
and of how we have let precious opportunities slip
through our slack hands, we may well bow rebuked
before the exhortation, &ldquo;Walk in wisdom toward
them that are without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we think of the stream of words ever
flowing from our lips, and how few grains of gold
that stream has brought down amid all its sand, and
how seldom Christ&#8217;s name has been spoken by us
to hearts that heed Him not nor know Him, the
exhortation, &ldquo;Let your speech be always with
grace,&rdquo; becomes an indictment as truly as a command.</p>

<p>There is but one place for us, the foot of the
cross, that there we may obtain forgiveness for all
the faulty past and thence may draw consecration
and strength for the future, to enable us to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
that lofty law of Christian morality, which is high
and hard if we think only of its precepts, but
becomes light and easy when we open our hearts to
receive the power for obedience, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; as this
great Epistle manifoldly teaches, &ldquo;is Christ in you,
the hope of glory.&rdquo;</p>

known unto you all things that <i>are done</i> here.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col.</span> iv. 7&ndash;9 (Rev.
Ver.).</p></div>

<p>In Paul&#8217;s days it was perhaps more difficult to get
letters delivered than to write them. It was a
long, weary journey from Rome to Colossæ,&mdash;across
Italy, then by sea to Greece, across Greece, then by
sea to the port of Ephesus, and thence by rough
ways to the upland valley where lay Colossæ, with
its neighbouring towns of Laodicea and Hierapolis.
So one thing which the Apostle has to think about
is to find messengers to carry his letter. He pitches
upon these two, Tychicus and Onesimus. The
former is one of his personal attendants, told off for
this duty; the other, who has been in Rome under
very peculiar circumstances, is going home to
Colossæ, on a strange errand, in which he may be
helped by having a message from Paul to carry.</p>

<p>We shall not now deal with the words before us,
so much as with these two figures, whom we may
regard as representing certain principles, and embodying
some useful lessons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
I. Tychicus may stand as representing the greatness
and sacredness of small and secular service
done for Christ.</p>

<p>We must first try, in as few words as may be, to
change the name into a man. There is something
very solemn and pathetic in these shadowy names
which appear for a moment on the page of Scripture,
and are swallowed up of black night, like stars that
suddenly blaze out for a week or two, and then
dwindle and at last disappear altogether. They too
lived, and loved, and strove, and suffered, and enjoyed:
and now&mdash;all is gone, gone; the hot fire
burned down to such a little handful of white ashes.
Tychicus and Onesimus! two shadows that once
were men! and as they are, so we shall be.</p>

<p>As to Tychicus, there are several fragmentary
notices about him in the Acts of the Apostles and in
Paul&#8217;s letters, and although they do not amount to
much, still by piecing them together, and looking at
them with some sympathy, we can get a notion of
the man.</p>

<p>He does not appear till near the end of Paul&#8217;s
missionary work, and was probably one of the fruits
of the Apostle&#8217;s long residence in Ephesus on his
last missionary tour, as we do not hear of him till
after that period. That stay in Ephesus was cut
short by the silversmiths&#8217; riot&mdash;the earliest example
of trades&#8217; unions&mdash;when they wanted to silence the
preaching of the gospel because it damaged the
market for &ldquo;shrines,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>also</i>&rdquo; was an insult to
the great goddess! Thereupon Paul retired to
Europe, and after some months there, decided on
his last fateful journey to Jerusalem. On the way
he was joined by a remarkable group of friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
seven in number, and apparently carefully selected
so as to represent the principal fields of the Apostle&#8217;s
labours. There were three Europeans, two from
&ldquo;Asia&rdquo;&mdash;meaning by that name, of course, only the
Roman province, which included mainly the western
seaboard&mdash;and two from the wilder inland country
of Lycaonia. Tychicus was one of the two from
Asia; the other was Trophimus, whom we know to
have been an Ephesian (Acts xxi. 29), as Tychicus
may not improbably have also been.</p>

<p>We do not know that all the seven accompanied
Paul to Jerusalem. Trophimus we know did, and
another of them, Aristarchus, is mentioned as having
sailed with him on the return voyage from Palestine
(Acts xxvii. 2). But if they were not intended to
go to Jerusalem, why did they meet him at all?
The sacredness of the number seven, the apparent
care to secure a representation of the whole field of
apostolic activity, and the long distances that some
of them must have travelled, make it extremely
unlikely that these men should have met him at a
little port in Asia Minor for the mere sake of being
with him for a few days. It certainly seems much
more probable that they joined his company and
went on to Jerusalem. What for? Probably as
bearers of money contributions from the whole area
of the Gentile Churches, to the &ldquo;poor saints&rdquo; there&mdash;a
purpose which would explain the composition
of the delegation. Paul was too sensitive and too
sagacious to have more to do with money matters
than he could help. We learn from his letter to
the Church at Corinth that he insisted on another
brother being associated with him in the administration
of their alms, so that no man could raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
suspicions against him. Paul&#8217;s principle was that
which ought to guide every man entrusted with
other people&#8217;s money to spend for religious or
charitable purposes&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not be your almoner
unless some one appointed by you stands by me to
see that I spend your money rightly&rdquo;&mdash;a good example
which, it is much to be desired, were followed
by all workers, and required to be followed as a
condition of all giving.</p>

<p>These seven, at all events, began the long journey
with Paul. Among them is our friend Tychicus,
who may have learned to know the Apostle more
intimately during it, and perhaps developed qualities
in travel which marked him out as fit for the errand
on which we here find him.</p>

<p>This voyage was about the year 58 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Then
comes an interval of some three or four years, in
which occur Paul&#8217;s arrest and imprisonment at
Cæsarea, his appearance before governors and kings,
his voyage to Italy and shipwreck, with his residence
in Rome. Whether Tychicus was with him during
all this period, as Luke seems to have been, we do
not know, nor at what point he joined the Apostle,
if he was not his companion throughout. But
the verses before us show that he was with Paul
during part of his first Roman captivity, probably
about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 62 or 63; and their commendation of
him as &ldquo;a faithful minister,&rdquo; or helper of Paul, implies
that for a considerable period before this he
had been rendering services to the Apostle.</p>

<p>He is now despatched all the long way to Colossæ
to carry this letter, and to tell the Church by word
of mouth all that had happened in Rome. No information
of that kind is in the letter itself. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
silence forms a remarkable contrast to the affectionate
abundance of personal details in another prison
letter, that to the Philippians, and probably marks
this Epistle as addressed to a Church never visited
by Paul. Tychicus is sent, according to the most
probable reading, that &ldquo;ye may know our estate,
and that he may comfort your hearts&rdquo;&mdash;encouraging
the brethren to Christian stedfastness, not only
by his news of Paul, but by his own company and
exhortations.</p>

<p>The very same words are employed about him
in the contemporaneous letter to the Ephesians.
Evidently, then, he carried both epistles on the same
journey; and one reason for selecting him as messenger
is plainly that he was a native of the
province, and probably of Ephesus. When Paul
looked round his little circle of attendant friends, his
eye fell on Tychicus, as the very man for such an
errand. &ldquo;You go, Tychicus. It is your home; they
all know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most careful students now think that the
Epistle to the Ephesians was meant to go the round
of the Churches of Asia Minor, beginning, no doubt,
with that in the great city of Ephesus. If that be
so, and Tychicus had to carry it to these Churches
in turn, he would necessarily come, in the course of
his duty, to Laodicea, which was only a few miles
from Colossæ, and so could most conveniently
deliver this Epistle. The wider and the narrower
mission fitted into each other.</p>

<p>No doubt he went, and did his work. We can
fancy the eager groups, perhaps in some upper room,
perhaps in some quiet place of prayer by the river
side; in their midst the two messengers, with a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
knot of listeners and questioners round each. How
they would have to tell the story a dozen times
over! how every detail would be precious! how
tears would come and hearts would glow! how deep
into the night they would talk! and how many a
heart that had begun to waver would be confirmed
in cleaving to Christ by the exhortations of
Tychicus, by the very sight of Onesimus, and by
Paul&#8217;s words of fire!</p>

<p>What became of Tychicus after that journey we
do not know. Perhaps he settled down at Ephesus
for a time, perhaps he returned to Paul. At any
rate, we get two more glimpses of him at a later
period&mdash;one in the Epistle to Titus, in which we
hear of the Apostle&#8217;s intention to despatch him
on another journey to Crete, and the last in the
close of the second Epistle to Timothy, written
from Rome probably about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 67. The Apostle
believes that his death is near, and seems to have
sent away most of his staff. Among the notices of
their various appointments we read, &ldquo;Tychicus have
I sent to Ephesus.&rdquo; He is not said to have been
sent on any mission connected with the Churches.
It may be that he was simply sent away because,
by reason of his impending martyrdom, Paul had no
more need of him. True, he still has Luke by him,
and he wishes Timothy to come and bring his first
&ldquo;minister,&rdquo; Mark, with him. But he has sent away
Tychicus, as if he had said, Now, go back to your
home, my friend! You have been a faithful servant
for ten years. I need you no more. Go to your
own people, and take my blessing. God be with
you! So they parted, he that was for death, to
die! and he that was for life, to live and to treasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the memory of Paul in his heart for the rest of his
days. These are the facts; ten years of faithful
service to the Apostle, partly during his detention
in Rome, and much of it spent in wearisome and
dangerous travelling undertaken to carry a couple
of letters.</p>

<p>As for his character, Paul has given us something
of it in these few words, which have commended
him to a wider circle than the handful of Christians
at Colossæ. As for his personal godliness and
goodness, he is &ldquo;a beloved brother,&rdquo; as are all who
love Christ; but he is also a &ldquo;faithful minister,&rdquo; or
personal attendant upon the Apostle. Paul always
seems to have had one or two such about him, from
the time of his first journey, when John Mark filled
the post, to the end of his career. Probably he was
no great hand at managing affairs, and needed some
plain common-sense nature beside him, who would
be secretary or amanuensis sometimes, and general
helper and factotum. Men of genius and men
devoted to some great cause which tyrannously
absorbs attention, want some person to fill such a
homely office. The person who filled it would be
likely to be a plain man, not gifted in any special
degree for higher service. Common sense, willingness
to be troubled with small details of purely
secular arrangements, and a hearty love for the chief,
and desire to spare him annoyance and work, were
the qualifications. Such probably was Tychicus&mdash;no
orator, no organiser, no thinker, but simply an
honest, loving soul, who did not shrink from rough
outward work, if only it might help the cause. We
do not read that he was a teacher or preacher, or
miracle worker. His gift was&mdash;ministry, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
gave himself to his ministry. His business was to
run Paul&#8217;s errands, and, like a true man, he ran
them &ldquo;faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then, he is fairly taken as representing the
greatness and sacredness of small and secular service
for Christ. For the Apostle goes on to add something
to his eulogium as a &ldquo;faithful minister&rdquo;&mdash;when
he calls him &ldquo;a fellow-servant,&rdquo; or slave, &ldquo;in
the Lord.&rdquo; As if he had said, Do not suppose that
because I write this letter, and Tychicus carries it,
there is much difference between us. We are both
slaves of the same Lord who has set each of us
his tasks; and though the tasks be different, the
obedience is the same, and the doers stand on one
level. I am not Tychicus&#8217; master, though he be my
minister. We have both, as I have been reminding
you that you all have, an owner in heaven. The
delicacy of the turn thus given to the commendation
is a beautiful indication of Paul&#8217;s generous,
chivalrous nature. No wonder that such a soul
bound men like Tychicus to him!</p>

<p>But there is more than merely a revelation of a
beautiful character in the words; there are great
truths in them. We may draw them out in two or
three thoughts.</p>

<p>Small things done for Christ are great. Trifles
that contribute and are indispensable to a great
result are great; or perhaps, more properly, both
words are out of place. In some powerful engine
there is a little screw, and if it drop out, the great
piston cannot rise nor the huge crank turn. What
have big and little to do with things which are
equally indispensable? There is a great rudder that
steers an ironclad. It moves on a &ldquo;pintle&rdquo; a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
inches long. If that bit of iron were gone, what
would become of the rudder, and what would be the
use of the ship with all her guns? There is an old
jingling rhyme about losing a shoe for want of a
nail, and a horse for want of a shoe, and a man for
want of a horse, and a battle for want of a man, and
a kingdom for loss of a battle. The intervening
links may be left out&mdash;and the nail and the kingdom
brought together. In a similar spirit, we may
say that the trifles done for Christ which help the
great things are as important as these. What is
the use of writing letters, if you cannot get them
delivered? It takes both Paul and Tychicus to get
the letter into the hands of the people at Colossæ.</p>

<p>Another thought suggested by the figure of
Paul&#8217;s minister, who was also his fellow-slave, is the
sacredness of secular work done for Christ. When
Tychicus is caring for Paul&#8217;s comfort, and looking
after common things for him, he is serving Christ,
and his work is &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; That is equivalent
to saying that the distinction between sacred and
secular, religious and non-religious, like that of great
and small, disappears from work done for and in
Jesus. Whenever there is organization, there must
be much work concerned with purely material
things: and the most spiritual forces must have
some organization. There must be men for &ldquo;the
outward business of the house of God&rdquo; as well as
white-robed priests at the altar, and the rapt gazer
in the secret place of the Most High. There are
a hundred matters of detail and of purely outward
and mechanical sort which must be seen to by
somebody. The alternative is to do them in a
purely mechanical and secular manner and so to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
make the work utterly dreary and contemptible, or
in a devout and earnest manner and so to hallow
them all, and make worship of them all. The
difference between two lives is not in the material
on which, but in the motive from which, and in the
end for which, they are respectively lived. All work
done in obedience to the same Lord is the same in
essence; for it is all obedience; and all work done
for the same God is the same in essence, for it is
all worship. The distinction between secular and
sacred ought never to have found its way into
Christian morals, and ought for evermore to be
expelled from Christian life.</p>

<p>Another thought may be suggested&mdash;fleeting
things done for Christ are eternal. How astonished
Tychicus would have been if anybody had told him
on that day when he got away from Rome, with
the two precious letters in his scrip, that these bits
of parchment would outlast all the ostentatious
pomp of the city, and that his name, because written
in them, would be known to the end of time all over
the world! The eternal things are the things done
for Christ. They are eternal in His memory who
has said, &ldquo;I will never forget any of their works,&rdquo;
however they may fall from man&#8217;s remembrance.
They are perpetual in their consequences. True, no
man&#8217;s contribution to the mighty sum of things
&ldquo;that make for righteousness&rdquo; can very long be
traced as separate from the others, any more than
the raindrop that refreshed the harebell on the moor
can be traced in burn, and river, and sea. But for
all that, it is there. So our influence for good blends
with a thousand others, and may not be traceable
beyond a short distance, still it is there: and no true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
work for Christ, abortive as it may seem, but goes to
swell the great aggregate of forces which are working
on through the ages to bring the perfect Order.</p>

<p>That Colossian Church seems a failure. Where
is it now? Gone. Where are its sister Churches
of Asia? Gone. Paul&#8217;s work and Tychicus&#8217; seem to
have vanished from the earth, and Mohammedanism
to have taken its place. Yes! and here are we
to-day in England, and Christian men all over the
world in lands that were mere slaughterhouses of
savagery then, learning our best lessons from Paul&#8217;s
words, and owing something for our knowledge of
them to Tychicus&#8217; humble care. Paul meant to
teach a handful of obscure believers&mdash;he has edified
the world. Tychicus thought to carry the precious
letter safely over the sea&mdash;he was helping to send it
across the centuries, and to put it into our hands.
So little do we know where our work will terminate.
Our only concern is where it begins. Let us look
after this end, the motive; and leave God to take
care of the other, the consequences.</p>

<p>Such work will be perpetual in its consequences
on ourselves. &ldquo;Though Israel be not gathered, yet
shall I be glorious.&rdquo; Whether our service for Christ
does others any good or no, it will bless ourselves,
by strengthening the motives from which it springs,
by enlarging our own knowledge and enriching our
own characters, and by a hundred other gracious influences
which His work exerts upon the devout
worker, and which become indissoluble parts of himself,
and abide with him for ever, over and above the
crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>

<p>And, as the reward is given not to the outward
deed, but to the motive which settles its value, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
work done from the same motive is alike in reward,
howsoever different in form. Paul in the front, and
Tychicus obscure in the rear, the great teachers and
path-openers whom Christ through the ages raises
up for large spiritual work, and the little people
whom Christ through the ages raises up to help and
sympathize&mdash;shall share alike at last, if the Spirit
that moved them has been the same, and if in
different administrations they have served the same
Lord. &ldquo;He that receiveth a prophet in the name
of a prophet&rdquo;&mdash;though no prophecy come from his
lips&mdash;&ldquo;shall receive a prophet&#8217;s reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. We must now turn to a much briefer consideration
of the second figure here, Onesimus, as
representing the transforming and uniting power of
Christian faith.</p>

<p>No doubt this is the same Onesimus as we read
of in the Epistle to Philemon. His story is familiar
and need not be dwelt on. He had been an &ldquo;unprofitable
servant,&rdquo; good-for-nothing, and apparently
had robbed his master, and then fled. He had
found his way to Rome, to which all the scum of
the empire seemed to drift. There he had burrowed
in some hole, and found obscurity and security.
Somehow or other he had come across Paul&mdash;surely
not, as has been supposed, having sought the
Apostle as a friend of his master&#8217;s, which would
rather have been a reason for avoiding him. However
that may be, he had found Paul, and Paul&#8217;s
Master had found <i>him</i> by the gospel which Paul
spoke. His heart had been touched. And now he
is to go back to his owner. With beautiful considerateness
the Apostle unites him with Tychicus in his
mission, and refers the Church to him as an authority.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
That is most delicate and thoughtful. The
same sensitive regard for his feelings marks the
language in which he is commended to them.
There is now no word about &ldquo;a fellow-slave&rdquo;&mdash;that
might have been misunderstood and might have
hurt. Paul will only say about him half of what
he said about Tychicus. He cannot leave out the
&ldquo;faithful,&rdquo; because Onesimus had been eminently
unfaithful, and so he attaches it to that half of his
former commendation which he retains, and testifies
to him as &ldquo;a faithful and beloved brother.&rdquo; There
are no references to his flight or to his peculations.
Philemon is the person to be spoken to about these.
The Church has nothing to do with them. The
man&#8217;s past was blotted out&mdash;enough that he is
&ldquo;faithful,&rdquo; exercising trust in Christ, and therefore
to be trusted. His condition was of no moment&mdash;enough
that he is &ldquo;a brother,&rdquo; therefore to be beloved.</p>

<p>Does not then that figure stand forth a living
illustration of the <i>transforming</i> power of Christianity?
Slaves had well-known vices, largely the result of
their position&mdash;idleness, heartlessness, lying, dishonesty.
And this man had had his full share of
the sins of his class. Think of him as he left Colossæ,
slinking from his master, with stolen property in his
bosom, madness and mutiny in his heart, an ignorant
heathen, with vices and sensualities holding carnival
in his soul. Think of him as he came back, Paul&#8217;s
trusted representative, with desires after holiness in
his deepest nature, the light of the knowledge of a
loving and pure God in his soul, a great hope before
him, ready for all service and even to put on again
the abhorred yoke! What had happened? Nothing
but this&mdash;the message had come to him, &ldquo;Onesimus!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
fugitive, rebel, thief as thou art, Jesus Christ has died
for thee, and lives to cleanse and bless thee. Believest
thou this?&rdquo; And he believed, and leant his
whole sinful self on that Saviour, and the corruption
faded away from his heart, and out of the thief was
made a trustworthy man, and out of the slave a
beloved brother. The cross had touched his heart
and will. That was all. It had changed his whole
being. He is a living illustration of Paul&#8217;s teaching
in this very letter. He is dead with Christ to his
old self; he lives with Christ a new life.</p>

<p>The gospel can do that. It can and does do so
to-day and to us, if we will. Nothing else can;
nothing else ever has done it; nothing else ever will.
Culture may do much; social reformation may do
much; but the radical transformation of the nature
is only effected by the &ldquo;love of God shed abroad in
the heart,&rdquo; and by the new life which we receive
through our faith in Christ.</p>

<p>That change can be produced on all sorts and
conditions of men. The gospel despairs of none.
It knows of no hopelessly irreclaimable classes. It
can kindle a soul under the ribs of death. The
filthiest rags can be cleaned and made into spotlessly
white paper, which may have the name of God
written upon it. None are beyond its power;
neither the savages in other lands, nor the more
hopeless heathens festering and rotting in our back
slums, the opprobrium of our civilization and the indictment
of our Christianity. Take the gospel that
transformed this poor slave, to them, and some hearts
will own it, and we shall pick out of the kennel souls
blacker than his, and make them like him, brethren,
faithful and beloved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Further, here is a living illustration of the power
which the gospel has of binding men into a true
brotherhood. We can scarcely picture to ourselves
the gulf which separated the master from his slave.
&ldquo;So many slaves, so many enemies,&rdquo; said Seneca.
That great crack running through society was a
chief weakness and peril of the ancient world. Christianity
gathered master and slave into one family,
and set them down at one table to commemorate
the death of the Saviour who held them all in the
embrace of His great love.</p>

<p>All true union among men must be based upon
their oneness in Jesus Christ. The brotherhood of
man is a consequence of the fatherhood of God, and
Christ shows us the Father. If the dreams of men&#8217;s
being knit together in harmony are ever to be more
than dreams, the power that makes them facts must
flow from the cross. The world must recognise that
&ldquo;One is your master,&rdquo; before it comes to believe as
anything more than the merest sentimentality that
&ldquo;all ye are brethren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much has to be done before the dawn of that day
reddens in the east, &ldquo;when, man to man, the wide
world o&#8217;er, shall brothers be,&rdquo; and much in political
and social life has to be swept away before society is
organized on the basis of Christian fraternity. The
vision tarries. But we may remember how certainly,
though slowly, the curse of slavery has disappeared,
and take courage to believe that all other evils will
fade away in like manner, until the cords of love
shall bind all hearts in fraternal unity, because they
bind each to the cross of the Elder Brother, through
whom we are no more slaves but sons, and if sons of
God, then brethren of one another.</p>

each other by face, clasping hands across the
seas, and feeling that the repulsions of nationality,
language, conflicting interests, have disappeared in
the unity of faith. These greetings are a most
striking, because unconscious, testimony to the
reality and strength of the new bond that knit
Christian souls together.</p>

<p>There are three sets of salutations here, sent
from Rome to the little far-off Phrygian town in
its secluded valley. The first is from three large-hearted
Jewish Christians, whose greeting has a
special meaning as coming from that wing of the
Church which had least sympathy with Paul&#8217;s work or
converts. The second is from the Colossians&#8217; towns-man
Epaphras; and the third is from two Gentiles like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
themselves, one well known as Paul&#8217;s most faithful
friend, one almost unknown, of whom Paul has
nothing to say, and of whom nothing good can be
said. All these may yield us matter for consideration.
It is interesting to piece together what we
know of the bearers of these shadowy names. It is
profitable to regard them as exponents of certain
tendencies and principles.</p>

<p>1. These three sympathetic Jewish Christians may
stand as types of a progressive and non-ceremonial
Christianity.</p>

<p>We need spend little time in outlining the figures
of these three, for he in the centre is well known to
every one, and his two supporters are little known
to any one. Aristarchus was a Thessalonian
(Acts xx. 4), and so perhaps one of Paul&#8217;s early
converts on his first journey to Europe. His purely
Gentile name would not have led us to expect him
to be a Jew. But we have many similar instances in
the New Testament, such for instance, as the names
of six of the seven deacons (Acts vii. 5), which show
that the Jews of &ldquo;the dispersion,&rdquo; who resided in
foreign countries, often bore no trace of their
nationality in their names. He was with Paul in
Ephesus at the time of the riot, and was one of the
two whom the excited mob, in their zeal for trade
and religion, dragged into the theatre, to the peril
of their lives. We next find him like Tychicus, a
member of the deputation which joined Paul on his
voyage to Jerusalem. Whatever was the case with
the other, Aristarchus was in Palestine with Paul,
for we learn that he sailed with him thence (Acts
xxvii. 2). Whether he kept company with Paul
during all the journey we do not know. But more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
probably he went home to Thessalonica, and afterwards
rejoined Paul at some point in his Roman
captivity. At any rate here he is, standing by Paul,
having drunk in his spirit, and enthusiastically
devoted to him and his work.</p>

<p>He receives here a remarkable and honourable
title, &ldquo;my fellow-prisoner.&rdquo; I suppose that it is to
be taken literally, and that Aristarchus was, in some
way, at the moment of writing, sharing Paul&#8217;s
imprisonment. Now it has been often noticed that,
in the Epistle to Philemon, where almost all these
names re-appear, it is not Aristarchus, but Epaphras,
who is honoured with this epithet; and that
interchange has been explained by an ingenious
supposition that Paul&#8217;s friends took it in turn to
keep him company, and were allowed to live with
him, on condition of submitting to the same
restrictions, military guardianship, and so on. There
is no positive evidence in favour of this, but it is
not improbable, and, if accepted, helps to give an
interesting glimpse of Paul&#8217;s prison life, and of the
loyal devotion which surrounded him.</p>

<p>Mark comes next. His story is well known&mdash;how
twelve years before, he had joined the first
missionary band from Antioch, of which his cousin
Barnabas was the leader, and had done well enough
as long as they were on known ground, in Barnabas&#8217;
(and perhaps his own) native island of Cyprus, but
had lost heart and run home to his mother as soon
as they crossed into Asia Minor. He had long ago
effaced the distrust of him which Paul naturally
conceived on account of this collapse. How he
came to be with Paul at Rome is unknown. It has
been conjectured that Barnabas was dead, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
so, Mark was free to join the Apostle; but that is
unsupported supposition. Apparently he is now
purposing a journey to Asia Minor, in the course of
which, if he should come to Colossæ (which was
doubtful, perhaps on account of its insignificance),
Paul repeats his previous injunction, that the church
should give him a cordial welcome. Probably this
commendation was given because the evil odour of
his old fault might still hang about his name. The
calculated emphasis of the exhortation, &ldquo;receive
him,&rdquo; seems to show that there was some reluctance
to give him a hearty reception and take him to
their hearts. So we have an &ldquo;undesigned coincidence.&rdquo;
The tone of the injunction here is
naturally explained by the story in the Acts.</p>

<p>So faithful a friend did he prove, that the lonely
old man, fronting death, longed to have his affectionate
tending once more; and his last word about
him, &ldquo;Take Mark, and bring him with thee, for he
is profitable to me for <i>the ministry</i>,&rdquo; condones the
early fault, and restores him to the office which, in a
moment of selfish weakness, he had abandoned. So
it is possible to efface a faultful past, and to acquire
strength and fitness for work, to which we are by
nature most inapt and indisposed. Mark is an
instance of early faults nobly atoned for, and a
witness of the power of repentance and faith to
overcome natural weakness. Many a ragged colt
makes a noble horse.</p>

<p>The third man is utterly unknown&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus, which
is called Justus.&rdquo; How startling to come across
that name, borne by this obscure Christian! How
it helps us to feel the humble manhood of Christ,
by showing us that many another Jewish boy bore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
the same name; common and undistinguished then,
though too holy to be given to any since. His surname
Justus may, perhaps, like the same name given
to James, the first bishop of the Church in Jerusalem,
hint his rigorous adherence to Judaism, and so may
indicate that, like Paul himself, he came from the
straitest sect of their religion into the large liberty
in which he now rejoiced.</p>

<p>He seems to have been of no importance in the
Church, for his name is the only one in this context
which does not re-appear in Philemon, and we never
hear of him again. A strange fate his! to be made
immortal by three words&mdash;and because he wanted
to send a loving message to the Church at Colossæ!
Why, men have striven and schemed, and broken
their hearts, and flung away their lives, to grasp the
bubble of posthumous fame; and how easily this
good &ldquo;Jesus which is called Justus&rdquo; has got it!
He has his name written for ever on the world&#8217;s
memory, and he very likely never knew it, and does
not know it, and was never a bit the better for it!
What a satire on &ldquo;the last infirmity of noble minds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These three men are united in this salutation,
because they are all three, &ldquo;of the circumcision;&rdquo;
that is to say, are Jews, and being so, have separated
themselves from all the other Jewish Christians in
Rome, and have flung themselves with ardour into
Paul&#8217;s missionary work among the Gentiles, and
have been his fellow-workers for the advancement of
the kingdom&mdash;aiding him, that is, in seeking to win
willing subjects to the loving, kingly will of God.
By this co-operation in the aim of his life, they have
been a &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; to him. He uses a half medical
term, which perhaps he had caught from the physician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
at his elbow, which we might perhaps parallel
by saying they had been a &ldquo;cordial&rdquo; to him&mdash;like a
refreshing draught to a weary man, or some whiff of
pure air stealing into a close chamber and lifting the
damp curls on some hot brow.</p>

<p>Now these three men, the only three Jewish
Christians in Rome who had the least sympathy
with Paul and his work, give us, in their isolation, a
vivid illustration of the antagonism which he had to
face from that portion of the early Church. The
great question for the first generation of Christians
was, not whether Gentiles might enter the Christian
community, but whether they must do so by circumcision,
and pass through Judaism on their road to
Christianity. The bulk of the Palestinian Jewish
Christians naturally held that they must; while the
bulk of Jewish Christians who had been born in
other countries as naturally held that they need not.
As the champion of this latter decision, Paul was
worried and counter-worked and hindered all his life
by the other party. They had no missionary zeal,
or next to none, but they followed in his wake and
made mischief wherever they could. If we can
fancy some modern sect that sends out no missionaries
of its own, but delights to come in where
better men have forced a passage, and to upset their
work by preaching its own crotchets, we get precisely
the kind of thing which dogged Paul all his life.</p>

<p>There was evidently a considerable body of these
men in Rome; good men no doubt in a fashion,
believing in Jesus as the Messiah, but unable to
comprehend that he had antiquated Moses, as the
dawning day makes useless the light in a dark place.
Even when he was a prisoner, their unrelenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
antagonism pursued the Apostle. They preached
Christ of &ldquo;envy and strife.&rdquo; Not one of them lifted
a finger to help him, or spoke a word to cheer him.
With none of them to say, God bless him! he toiled
on. Only these three were large-hearted enough to
take their stand by his side, and by this greeting to
clasp the hands of their Gentile brethren in Colossæ
and thereby to endorse the teaching of this letter as
to the abrogation of Jewish rites.</p>

<p>It was a brave thing to do, and the exuberance
of the eulogium shows how keenly Paul felt his
countrymen&#8217;s coldness, and how grateful he was to
&ldquo;the dauntless three.&rdquo; Only those who have lived
in an atmosphere of misconstruction, surrounded by
scowls and sneers, can understand what a cordial the
clasp of a hand, or the word of sympathy is. These
men were like the old soldier that stood on the
street of Worms, as Luther passed in to the Diet,
and clapped him on the shoulder, with &ldquo;Little monk!
little monk! you are about to make a nobler stand
to-day than we in all our battles have ever done. If
your cause is just, and you are sure of it, go forward
in God&#8217;s name, and fear nothing.&rdquo; If we can do no
more, we can give some one who is doing more a
cup of cold water, by our sympathy and taking our
place at his side, and <i>so</i> can be fellow-workers to the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p>We note, too, that the best comfort Paul could
have was help in his work. He did not go about
the world whimpering for sympathy. He was much
too strong a man for that. He wanted men to come
down into the trench with him, and to shovel and
wheel there till they had made in the wilderness
some kind of a highway for the King. The true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
cordial for a true worker is that others get into the
traces and pull by his side.</p>

<p>But we may further look at these men as representing
for us progressive as opposed to reactionary,
and spiritual as opposed to ceremonial Christianity.
Jewish Christians looked backwards; Paul and his
three sympathisers looked forward. There was
much excuse for the former. No wonder that they
shrank from the idea that things divinely appointed
could be laid aside. Now there is a broad distinction
between the divine in Christianity and the divine in
Judaism. For Jesus Christ is God&#8217;s last word, and
abides for ever. His divinity, His perfect sacrifice,
His present life in glory for us, His life within us,
these and their related truths are the perennial
possession of the Church. To Him we must look
back, and every generation till the end of time will
have to look back, as the full and final expression
of the wisdom and will and mercy of God. &ldquo;Last
of all He sent unto them His Son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That being distinctly understood, we need not
hesitate to recognise the transitory nature of much
of the embodiment of the eternal truth concerning
the eternal Christ. To draw the line accurately
between the permanent and the transient
would be to anticipate history and read the future.
But the clear recognition of the distinction between
the Divine revelation and the vessels in which it
is contained, between Christ and creed, between
Churches, forms of worship, formularies of faith on
the one hand, and the everlasting word of God
spoken to us once for all in His Son, and recorded
in Scripture, on the other, is needful at all times,
and especially at such times of sifting and unsettlement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
as the present. It will save some of us from
an obstinate conservatism which might read its fate
in the decline and disappearance of Jewish Christianity.
It will save us equally from needless fears,
as if the stars were going out, when it is only men-made
lamps that are paling. Men&#8217;s hearts often
tremble for the ark of God, when the only things in
peril are the cart that carries it, or the oxen that
draw it. &ldquo;We have received a kingdom that cannot
be moved,&rdquo; because we have received a King eternal,
and therefore may calmly see the removal of things
that can be shaken, assured that the things which
cannot be shaken will but the more conspicuously
assert their permanence. The existing embodiments
of God&#8217;s truth are not the highest, and if Churches
and forms crumble and disintegrate, their disappearance
will not be the abolition of Christianity, but its
progress. These Jewish Christians would have found
all that they strove to keep, in higher form and more
real reality, in Christ; and what seemed to them
the destruction of Judaism was really its coronation
with undying life.</p>

<p>II. Epaphras is for us the type of the highest
service which love can render.</p>

<p>All our knowledge of Epaphras is contained in
these brief notices in this Epistle. We learn from
the first chapter that he had introduced the gospel
to Colossæ, and perhaps also to Laodicea and
Hierapolis. He was &ldquo;one of you,&rdquo; a member of the
Colossian community, and a resident in, possibly a
native of, Colossæ. He had come to Rome, apparently
to consult the Apostle about the views
which threatened to disturb the Church. He had
told him, too, of their love, not painting the picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
too black, and gladly giving full prominence to any
bits of brightness. It was his report which led to
the writing of this letter.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the Colossians were not over
pleased with his having gone to speak with Paul,
and having brought down this thunderbolt on their
heads; and such a feeling may account for the
warmth of Paul&#8217;s praises of him as his &ldquo;fellow-slave,&rdquo;
and for the emphasis of his testimony on his
behalf. However they might doubt it, Epaphras&#8217;
love for them was warm. It showed itself by
continual fervent prayers that they might stand
&ldquo;perfect and fully persuaded in all the will of God,&rdquo;
and by toil of body and mind for them. We can
see the anxious Epaphras, far away from the Church
of his solicitude, always burdened with the thought
of their danger, and ever wrestling in prayer on their
behalf.</p>

<p>So we may learn the noblest service which
Christian love can do&mdash;prayer. There is a real
power in Christian intercession. There are many
difficulties and mysteries round that thought. The
manner of the blessing is not revealed, but the fact
that we help one another by prayer is plainly
taught, and confirmed by many examples, from the
day when God heard Abraham and delivered Lot,
to the hour when the loving authoritative words
were spoken, &ldquo;Simon, Simon, I have prayed for thee
that thy faith fail not.&rdquo; A spoonful of water sets
a hydraulic press in motion, and brings into
operation a force of tons&#8217; weight; so a drop of
prayer at the one end may move an influence at the
other which is omnipotent. It is a service which
all can render. Epaphras could not have written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
this letter, but he could pray. Love has no higher
way of utterance than prayer. A prayerless love
may be very tender, and may speak murmured
words of sweetest sound, but it lacks the deepest
expression, and the noblest music of speech. We
never help our dear ones so well as when we pray
for them. Do we thus show and consecrate our
family loves and our friendships?</p>

<p>We notice too the kind of prayer which love
naturally presents. It is constant and earnest&mdash;&ldquo;always
striving,&rdquo; or as the word might be rendered,
&ldquo;agonizing.&rdquo; That word suggests first the familiar
metaphor of the wrestling-ground. True prayer is
the intensest energy of the spirit pleading for
blessing with a great striving of faithful desire. But
a more solemn memory gathers round the word,
for it can scarcely fail to recall the hour beneath
the olives of Gethsemane, when the clear paschal
moon shone down on the suppliant who, &ldquo;being in
an agony, prayed the more earnestly.&rdquo; And both
Paul&#8217;s word here, and the evangelist&#8217;s there, carry
us back to that mysterious scene by the brook
Jabbok, where Jacob &ldquo;wrestled&rdquo; with &ldquo;a man&rdquo;
until the breaking of the day, and prevailed. Such
is prayer; the wrestle in the arena, the agony in
Gethsemane, the solitary grapple with the &ldquo;traveller
unknown&rdquo;; and such is the highest expression of
Christian love.</p>

<p>Here, too, we learn what love asks for its beloved.
Not perishable blessings, not the prizes of earth&mdash;fame,
fortune, friends; but that &ldquo;ye may stand
perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.&rdquo;
The first petition is for stedfastness. To stand has
for opposites&mdash;to fall, or totter, or give ground; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the prayer is that they may not yield to temptation,
or opposition, nor waver in their fixed faith, nor go
down in the struggle; but keep erect, their feet
planted on the rock, and holding their own against
every foe. The prayer is also for their maturity of
Christian character, that they may stand firm,
because perfect, having attained that condition which
Paul in this Epistle tell us is the aim of all preaching
and warning. As for ourselves, so for our dear ones,
we are to be content with nothing short of entire
conformity to the will of God. His merciful purpose
for us all is to be the goal of our efforts for ourselves,
and of our prayers for others. We are to
widen our desires to coincide with His gift, and our
prayers are to cover no narrower space than His
promises enclose.</p>

<p>Epaphras&#8217; last desire for his friends, according to
the true reading, is that they may be &ldquo;fully assured&rdquo;
in all the will of God. There can be no higher
blessing than that&mdash;to be quite sure of what God
desires me to know and do and be&mdash;if the assurance
comes from the clear light of His illumination, and
not from hasty self-confidence in my own penetration.
To be free from the misery of intellectual doubts
and practical uncertainties, to walk in the sunshine&mdash;is
the purest joy. And it is granted in needful
measure to all who have silenced their own wills,
that they may hear what God says,&mdash;&ldquo;If any man
wills to do His will, he shall know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does our love speak in prayer? and do our
prayers for our dear ones plead chiefly for such gifts?
Both our love and our desires need purifying if this
is to be their natural language. How can we offer
such prayers for them if, at the bottom of our hearts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
we had rather see them well off in the world than
stedfast, matured and assured Christians? How
can we expect an answer to such prayers if the
whole current of our lives shows that neither for
them nor for ourselves do we &ldquo;seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness&rdquo;?</p>

<p>III. The last salutation comes from a singularly
contrasted couple&mdash;Luke and Demas, the types
respectively of faithfulness and apostasy. These
two unequally yoked together stand before us like
the light and the dark figures that Ary Scheffer
delights to paint, each bringing out the colouring
of the other more vividly by contrast. They bear
the same relation to Paul which John, the beloved
disciple, and Judas did to Paul&#8217;s master.</p>

<p>As for Luke, his long and faithful companionship
of the Apostle is too well known to need repetition
here. His first appearance in the Acts nearly coincides
with an attack of Paul&#8217;s constitutional malady,
which gives probability to the suggestion that one
reason for Luke&#8217;s close attendance on the Apostle
was the state of his health. Thus the form and
warmth of the reference here would be explained&mdash;&ldquo;Luke
the physician, the beloved.&rdquo; We trace Luke
as sharing the perils of the winter voyage to Italy,
making his presence known only by the modest
&ldquo;we&rdquo; of the narrative. We find him here sharing
the Roman captivity, and, in the second imprisonment,
he was Paul&#8217;s only companion. All others
had been sent away, or had fled; but Luke could
not be spared, and would not desert him, and no
doubt was by his side till the end, which soon came.</p>

<p>As for Demas, we know no more about him except
the melancholy record, &ldquo;Demas hath forsaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
me, having loved this present world; and is departed
unto Thessalonica.&rdquo; Perhaps he was a Thessalonian,
and so went home. His love of the world, then,
was his reason for abandoning Paul. Probably it was
on the side of danger that the world tempted him.
He was a coward, and preferred a whole skin to a
clear conscience. In immediate connection with the
record of his desertion we read, &ldquo;At my first answer,
no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.&rdquo;
As the same word is used, probably Demas may
have been one of those timid friends, whose courage
was not equal to standing by Paul when, to use his
own metaphor, he thrust his head into the lion&#8217;s
mouth. Let us not be too hard on the constancy
that warped in so fierce a heat. All that Paul
charges him with is, that he was a faithless friend,
and too fond of the present world. Perhaps his
crime did not reach the darker hue. He may not
have been an apostate Christian, though he was a
faithless friend. Perhaps, if there were departure
from Christ as well as from Paul, he came back
again, like Peter, whose sins against love and friendship
were greater than his&mdash;and, like Peter, found
pardon and a welcome. Perhaps, away in Thessalonica,
he repented him of his evil, and perhaps Paul
and Demas met again before the throne, and there
clasped inseparable hands. Let us not judge a man
of whom we know so little, but take to ourselves the
lesson of humility and self-distrust!</p>

<p>How strikingly these two contrasted characters
bring out the possibility of men being exposed to
the same influences and yet ending far away from
each other! These two set out from the same
point, and travelled side by side, subject to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
training, in contact with the magnetic attraction of
Paul&#8217;s strong personality, and at the end they are
wide as the poles asunder. Starting from the same
level, one line inclines ever so little upwards, the
other imperceptibly downwards. Pursue them far
enough, and there is room for the whole solar system
with all its orbits in the space between them. So
two children trained at one mother&#8217;s knee, subjects
of the same prayers, with the same sunshine of love
and rain of good influences upon them both, may
grow up, one to break a mother&#8217;s heart and disgrace
a father&#8217;s home, and the other to walk in the ways
of godliness and serve the God of his fathers. Circumstances
are mighty; but the use we make of
circumstances lies with ourselves. As we trim our
sails and set our rudder, the same breeze will take
us in opposite directions. We are the architects
and builders of our own characters, and may so use
the most unfavourable influences as to strengthen
and wholesomely harden our natures thereby, and
may so misuse the most favourable as only thereby
to increase our blameworthiness for wasted opportunities.</p>

<p>We are reminded, also, from these two men who
stand before us like a double star&mdash;one bright and
one dark&mdash;that no loftiness of Christian position,
nor length of Christian profession is a guarantee
against falling and apostasy. As we read in another
book, for which also the Church has to thank a
prison cell&mdash;the place where so many of its precious
possessions have been written&mdash;there is a backway
to the pit from the gate of the Celestial City.
Demas had stood high in the Church, had been
admitted to the close intimacy of the Apostle, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
evidently no raw novice, and yet the world could
drag him back from so eminent a place in which he
had long stood. &ldquo;Let him that thinketh he standeth
take heed lest he fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The world that was too strong for Demas will be
too strong for us if we front it in our own strength.
It is ubiquitous, working on us everywhere and
always, like the pressure of the atmosphere on our
bodies. Its weight will crush us unless we can
climb to and dwell on the heights of communion
with God, where pressure is diminished. It acted
on Demas through his fears. It acts on us through
our ambitions, affections and desires. So, seeing that
miserable wreck of Christian constancy, and considering
ourselves lest we also be tempted, let us
not judge another, but look at home. There is more
than enough there to make profound self-distrust
our truest wisdom, and to teach us to pray, &ldquo;Hold
Thou me up, and I shall be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a marked love of triplets in these
closing messages. There were three of the
circumcision who desired to salute the Colossians;
and there were three Gentiles whose greetings
followed these. Now we have a triple message
from the Apostle himself&mdash;his greeting to Laodicea,
his message as to the interchange of letters
with that Church, and his grave, stringent charge
to Archippus. Finally, the letter closes with a few
hurried words in his own handwriting, which also
are threefold, and seem to have been added in
extreme haste, and to be compressed to the utmost
possible brevity.</p>

<p>I. We shall first look at the threefold greeting
and warnings to Laodicea.</p>

<p>In the first part of this triple message we have a
glimpse of the Christian life of that city, &ldquo;Salute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the brethren that are in Laodicea.&rdquo; These are, of
course, the whole body of Christians in the neighbouring
town, which was a much more important
place than Colossæ. They are the same persons as
&ldquo;the Church of the Laodiceans.&rdquo; Then comes a
special greeting to &ldquo;Nymphas,&rdquo; who was obviously
a brother of some importance and influence in the
Laodicean Church, though to us he has sunk to be
an empty name. With him Paul salutes &ldquo;the
Church that is in <i>their</i> house&rdquo; (Rev. Ver.). Whose
house? Probably that belonging to Nymphas and
his family. Perhaps that belonging to Nymphas
and the Church that met in it, if these were other
than his family. The more difficult expression is
adopted by preponderating textual authorities, and
&ldquo;<i>his</i> house&rdquo; is regarded as a correction to make the
sense easier. If so, then the expression is one of
which in our ignorance we have lost the key, and
which must be content to leave unexplained.</p>

<p>But what was this &ldquo;Church in the house&rdquo;? We
read that Prisca and Aquila had such both in their
house in Rome (Rom. xvi. 5) and in Ephesus (1 Cor.
xvi. 19), and that Philemon had such in his house
at Colossæ. It may be that only the household of
Nymphas is meant, and that the words import no
more than that it was a Christian household; or it
may be, and more probably is, that in all these cases
there was some gathering of a few of the Christians
resident in each city, who were closely connected
with the heads of the household, and met in their
houses more or less regularly to worship and to
help one another in the Christian life. We have no
facts that decide which of these two suppositions is
correct. The early Christians had, of course no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
buildings especially used for their meetings, and
there may often have been difficulty in finding suitable
places, particularly in cities where the Church
was numerous. It may have been customary,
therefore, for brethren who had large and convenient
houses, to gather together portions of the whole
community in these. In any case, the expression
gives us a glimpse of the primitive elasticity of
Church order, and of the early fluidity, so to speak,
of ecclesiastical language. The word &ldquo;Church&rdquo;
has not yet been hardened and fixed to its present
technical sense. There was but one Church in
Laodicea, and yet within it there was this little
Church&mdash;an <i>imperium in imperio</i>&mdash;as if the word
had not yet come to mean more than an assembly,
and as if all arrangements of order and worship, and
all the terminology of later days, were undreamed of
yet. The life was there, but the forms which were
to grow out of the life, and to protect it sometimes,
and to stifle it often, were only beginning to show
themselves, and were certainly not yet felt to be
forms.</p>

<p>We may note, too, the beautiful glimpse we get
here of domestic and social religion.</p>

<p>If the Church in the house of Nymphas consisted
of his own family and dependants, it stands for us
as a lesson of what every family, which has a Christian
man or woman at its head, ought to be. Little
knowledge of the ordering of so-called Christian
households is needed to be sure that domestic religion
is wofully neglected to-day. Family worship
and family instruction are disused, one fears, in
many homes, the heads of which can remember both
in their father&#8217;s houses; and the unspoken aroma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
and atmosphere of religion does not fill the house
with its odour, as it ought to do. If a Christian
householder have not &ldquo;a Church in his house,&rdquo; the
family union is tending to become &ldquo;a synagogue of
Satan.&rdquo; One or other it is sure to be. It is a
solemn question for all parents and heads of households,
What am I doing to make my house a Church,
my family a family united by faith in Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>A like suggestion may be made if, as is possible,
the Church in the house of Nymphas included more
than relatives and dependants. It is a miserable thing
when social intercourse plays freely round every
other subject, and taboos all mention of religion.
It is a miserable thing when Christian people choose
and cultivate society for worldly advantages, business
connections, family advancement, and for every
reason under heaven&mdash;sometimes a long way under&mdash;except
those of a common faith, and of the desire to
increase it.</p>

<p>It is not needful to lay down extravagant, impracticable
restrictions, by insisting either that we
should limit our society to religious men, or our
conversation to religious subjects. But it is a bad
sign when our chosen associates are chosen for every
other reason but their religion, and when our talk
flows copiously on all other subjects, and becomes
a constrained driblet when religion comes to be
spoken of. Let us try to carry about with us an
influence which shall permeate all our social intercourse,
and make it, if not directly religious, yet
never antagonistic to religion, and always capable of
passing easily and naturally into the highest regions.
Our godly forefathers used to carve texts over their
house doors. Let us do the same in another fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
so that all who cross the threshold may feel that
they have come into a Christian household, where
cheerful godliness sweetens and brightens the sanctities
of home.</p>

<p>We have next a remarkable direction as to the
interchange of Paul&#8217;s letters to Colossæ and Laodicea.
The present Epistle is to be sent over to
the neighbouring Church of Laodicea&mdash;that is quite
clear. But what is &ldquo;the Epistle from Laodicea&rdquo;
which the Colossians are to be sure to get and to read?
The connection forbids us to suppose that a letter
written by the Laodicean Church is meant. Both
letters are plainly Pauline epistles, and the latter is
said to be &ldquo;from Laodicea,&rdquo; simply because the
Colossians were to procure it from that place. The
&ldquo;from&rdquo; does not imply authorship, but transmission.
What then has become of this letter? Is it lost?
So say some commentators; but a more probable
opinion is that it is no other than the Epistle which
we know as that to the Ephesians. This is not the
occasion to enter on a discussion of that view. It
will be enough to notice that very weighty textual
authorities omit the words &ldquo;In Ephesus,&rdquo; in the first
verse of that Epistle. The conjecture is a very
reasonable one, that the letter was intended for a
circle of Churches, and had originally no place named
in the superscription, just as we might issue circulars
&ldquo;To the Church in&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; leaving a blank to be
filled in with different names. This conjecture is
strengthened by the marked absence of personal
references in the letter, which in that respect forms
a striking contrast to the Epistle to the Colossians,
which it so strongly resembles in other particulars.
Probably, therefore, Tychicus had both letters put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
into his hands for delivery. The circular would go
first to Ephesus as the most important Church in
Asia, and thence would be carried by him to one
community after another, till he reached Laodicea,
from which he would come further up the valley
to Colossæ, bringing both letters with him. The
Colossians are not told to <i>get</i> the letter from Laodicea,
but to be sure that they <i>read</i> it. Tychicus would
see that it came to them; their business was to
see that they marked, learned, and inwardly digested
it.</p>

<p>The urgency of these instructions that Paul&#8217;s
letters should be read, reminds us of a similar but
still more stringent injunction in his earliest epistle
(1 Thess. v. 27), &ldquo;I charge you by the Lord that
this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.&rdquo; Is
it possible that these Churches did not much care
for Paul&#8217;s words, and were more willing to
admit that they were weighty and powerful, than to
study them and lay them to heart? It looks almost
like it. Perhaps they got the same treatment then
as they often do now, and were more praised than
read, even by those who professed to look upon him
as their teacher in Christ!</p>

<p>But passing by that, we come to the last part of
this threefold message, the solemn warning to a
slothful servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry
which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil
it.&rdquo; A sharp message that&mdash;and especially sharp,
as being sent through others, and not spoken directly
to the man himself. If this Archippus were a
member of the Church at Colossæ, it is remarkable
that Paul should not have spoken to him directly, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
he did to Euodia and Syntyche, the two good women
at Philippi, who had fallen out. But it is by no
means certain that he was. We find him named
again, indeed, at the beginning of the Epistle to
Philemon, in such immediate connection with the
latter, and with his wife Apphia, that he has been
supposed to be their son. At all events, he was
intimately associated with the Church in the house
of Philemon, who, as we know, was a Colossian.
The conclusion, therefore, seems at first sight most
natural that Archippus too belonged to the Colossian
Church. But on the other hand the difficulty
already referred to seems to point in another direction;
and if it be further remembered that this
whole section is concerned with the Church at
Laodicea, it will be seen to be a likely conclusion
from all the facts that Archippus, though perhaps a
native of Colossæ, or even a resident there, had his
&ldquo;ministry&rdquo; in connection with that other neighbouring
Church.</p>

<p>It may be worth notice, in passing, that all these
messages to Laodicea occurring here, strongly
favour the supposition that the epistle from that
place cannot have been a letter especially meant for
the Laodicean church, as, if it had been, these would
have naturally been inserted in it. So far, therefore,
they confirm the hypothesis that it was a circular.</p>

<p>Some may say, Well, what in the world does it
matter where Archippus worked? Not very much
perhaps; and yet one cannot but read this grave
exhortation to a man who was evidently getting
languid and negligent, without remembering what
we hear about Laodicea and the angel of the Church
there, when next we meet it in the page of Scripture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
It is not impossible that Archippus was that very
&ldquo;angel,&rdquo; to whom the Lord Himself sent the message
through His servant John, more awful than that
which Paul had sent through his brethren at
Colossæ, &ldquo;Because thou art neither cold nor hot, I
will spue thee out of My mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the message is for us all.
Each of us has a &ldquo;ministry,&rdquo; a sphere of service.
We may either fill it full, with earnest devotion and
patient heroism, as some expanding gas fills out the
silken round of its containing vessel, or we may
breathe into it only enough to occupy a little portion,
while all the rest hangs empty and flaccid. We
have to &ldquo;fulfil our ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sacred motive enhances the obligation&mdash;we
have received it &ldquo;<i>in</i> the Lord.&rdquo; In union with Him
it has been laid on us. No human hand has imposed
it, nor does it arise merely from earthly relationships,
but our fellowship with Jesus Christ, and
incorporation into the true Vine, has laid on us responsibilities,
and exalted us by service.</p>

<p>There must be diligent watchfulness, in order to
fulfil our ministry. We must take heed to our
service, and we must take heed to ourselves. We
have to reflect upon it, its extent, nature, imperativeness,
upon the manner of discharging it, and the
means of fitness for it. We have to keep our work
ever before us. Unless we are absorbed in it, we
shall not fulfil it. And we have to take heed to
ourselves, ever feeling our weakness and the strong
antagonisms in our own natures which hinder our
discharge of the plainest, most imperative duties.</p>

<p>And let us remember, too, that if once we begin,
like Archippus, to be a little languid and perfunctory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
in our work, we may end where the Church of
Laodicea ended, whether he were its angel or no,
with that nauseous lukewarmness which sickens
even Christ&#8217;s longsuffering love, and forces Him to
reject it with loathing.</p>

<p>II. And now we come to the end of our task,
and have to consider the hasty last words in Paul&#8217;s
own hand.</p>

<p>We can see him taking the reed from the amanuensis
and adding the three brief sentences which close
the letter. He first writes that which is equivalent
to our modern usage of signing the letter&mdash;&ldquo;the
salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.&rdquo; This
appears to have been his usual practice, or, as he
says in 2 Thess. (iii. 17), it was &ldquo;his token in every
epistle&rdquo;&mdash;the evidence that each was the genuine
expression of his mind. Probably his weak eyesight,
which appears certain, may have had something
to do with his employing a secretary, as we may
assume him to have done, even when there is no
express mention of his autograph in the closing
salutations. We find for example in the Epistle to
the Romans no words corresponding to these, but
the modest amanuensis steps for a moment into the
light near the end: &ldquo;I Tertius, who write the
epistle, salute you in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The endorsement with his name is followed by a
request singularly pathetic in its abrupt brevity,
&ldquo;Remember my bonds.&rdquo; This is the one personal
reference in the letter, unless we add as a second,
his request for their prayers that he may speak the
mystery of Christ, for which he is in bonds. There
is a striking contrast in this respect with the abundant
allusions to his circumstances in the Epistle to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the Philippians, which also belongs to the period of
his captivity. He had been swept far away from
thoughts of self by the enthusiasm of his subject.
The vision that opened before him of his Lord in
His glory, the Lord of Creation, the Head of the
Church, the throned helper of every trusting soul,
had flooded his chamber with light, and swept
guards and chains and restrictions out of his consciousness.
But now the spell is broken, and common
things re-assert their power. He stretches out
his hand for the reed to write his last words, and
as he does so, the chain which fastens him to the
Prætorian guard at his side pulls and hinders him.
He wakes to the consciousness of his prison. The
seer, swept along by the storm wind of a Divine
inspiration, is gone. The weak man remains. The
exhaustion after such an hour of high communion
makes him more than usually dependent; and all
his subtle profound teachings, all his thunderings
and lightnings, end in the simple cry, which goes
straight to the heart: &ldquo;Remember my bonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wished their remembrance because he needed
their sympathy. Like the old rags put round the
ropes by which the prophet was hauled out of his
dungeon, the poorest bit of sympathy twisted round
a fetter makes it chafe less. The petition helps us
to conceive how heavy a trial Paul felt his imprisonment,
to be little as he said about it, and bravely as he
bore it. He wished their remembrance too, because
his bonds added weight to his words. His sufferings
gave him a right to speak. In times of
persecution confessors are the highest teachers, and
the marks of the Lord Jesus borne in a man&#8217;s body
give more authority than diplomas and learning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
He wished their remembrance because his bonds
might encourage them to steadfast endurance if need
for it should arise. He points to his own sufferings,
and would have them take heart to bear their
lighter crosses and to fight their easier battle.</p>

<p>One cannot but recall the words of Paul&#8217;s Master,
so like these in sound, so unlike them in deepest
meaning. Can there be a greater contrast than between
&ldquo;Remember my bonds,&rdquo; the plaintive appeal of a
weak man seeking sympathy, coming as an appendix,
quite apart from the subject of the letter, and &ldquo;Do
this in remembrance of Me,&rdquo; the royal words of the
Master? Why is the memory of Christ&#8217;s death so
unlike the memory of Paul&#8217;s chains? Why is the
one merely for the play of sympathy, and the
enforcement of his teaching, and the other the very
centre of our religion? For one reason alone.
Because Christ&#8217;s death is the life of the world, and
Paul&#8217;s sufferings, whatever their worth, had nothing
in them that bore, except indirectly, on man&#8217;s redemption.
&ldquo;Was Paul crucified for you?&rdquo; We
remember his chains, and they give him sacredness
in our eyes. But we remember the broken body
and shed blood of our Lord, and cleave to it in faith
as the one sacrifice for the world&#8217;s sin.</p>

<p>And then comes the last word: &ldquo;Grace be with
you.&rdquo; The apostolic benediction, with which he
closes all his letters, occurs in many different stages
of expression. Here it is pared down to the very
quick. No shorter form is possible&mdash;and yet even
in this condition of extreme compression, all good
is in it.</p>

<p>All possible blessing is wrapped up in that one
word, Grace. Like the sunshine, it carries life and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
fruitfulness in itself. If the favour and kindness of
God, flowing out to men so far beneath Him, who
deserve such different treatment, be ours, then in our
hearts will be rest and a great peacefulness, whatever
may be about us, and in our characters will be
all beauties and capacities, in the measure of our
possession of that grace.</p>

<p>That all-productive germ of joy and excellence is
here parted among the whole body of Colossian
Christians. The dew of this benediction falls upon
them all&mdash;the teachers of error if they still held by
Christ, the Judaisers, the slothful Archippus, even
as the grace which it invokes will pour itself into
imperfect natures and adorn very sinful characters,
if beneath the imperfection and the evil there be the
true affiance of the soul on Christ.</p>

<p>That communication of grace to a sinful world is
the end of all God&#8217;s deeds, as it is the end of this
letter. That great revelation which began when
man began, which has spoken its complete message
in the Son, the heir of all things, as this Epistle
tells us, has this for the purpose of all its words&mdash;whether
they are terrible or gentle, deep or simple&mdash;that
God&#8217;s grace may dwell among men. The
mystery of Christ&#8217;s being, the agony of Christ&#8217;s
cross, the hidden glories of Christ&#8217;s dominion are
all for this end, that of His fulness we may all
receive, and grace for grace. The Old Testament,
true to its genius, ends with stern onward-looking
words which point to a future coming of the Lord
and to the possible terrible aspect of that coming&mdash;&ldquo;Lest
I come and smite the earth with a curse.&rdquo;
It is the last echo of the long drawn blast of the
trumpets of Sinai. The New Testament ends, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
our Epistle ends, and as we believe the weary
history of the world will end, with the benediction:
&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That grace, the love which pardons and quickens
and makes good and fair and wise and strong, is
offered to all in Christ. Unless we have accepted
it, God&#8217;s revelation and Christ&#8217;s work have failed as
far as we are concerned. &ldquo;We therefore, as fellow-workers
with Him, beseech you that ye receive not
the grace of God in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="PhilI" id="PhilI"></a>I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to
Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker, and to Apphia our sister,
and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the Church in thy house:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philem.</span> 1&ndash;3 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>This Epistle stands alone among Paul&#8217;s letters
in being addressed to a private Christian, and
in being entirely occupied with a small though very
singular private matter; its aim being merely to
bespeak a kindly welcome for a runaway slave who
had been induced to perform the unheard-of act of
voluntarily returning to servitude. If the New Testament
were simply a book of doctrinal teaching, this
Epistle would certainly be out of place in it; and
if the great purpose of revelation were to supply
material for creeds, it would be hard to see what
value could be attached to a simple, short letter, from
which no contribution to theological doctrine or
ecclesiastical order can be extracted. But if we do
not turn to it for discoveries of truth, we can find
in it very beautiful illustrations of Christianity at
work. It shows us the operation of the new forces
which Christ has lodged in humanity&mdash;and that on
two planes of action. It exhibits a perfect model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
of Christian friendship, refined and ennobled by a
half-conscious reflection of the love which has called
us &ldquo;no longer slaves but friends,&rdquo; and adorned by
delicate courtesies and quick consideration, which
divines with subtlest instinct what it will be sweetest
to the friend to hear, while it never approaches by
a hair-breadth to flattery, nor forgets to counsel high
duties. But still more important is the light which
the letter casts on the relation of Christianity to
slavery, which may be taken as a specimen of its
relation to social and political evils generally, and
yields fruitful results for the guidance of all who would
deal with such.</p>

<p>It may be observed, too, that most of the considerations
which Paul urges on Philemon as reasons
for his kindly reception of Onesimus do not even
need the alteration of a word, but simply a change
in their application, to become worthy statements
of the highest Christian truths. As Luther puts it,
&ldquo;We are all God&#8217;s Onesimuses&rdquo;; and the welcome
which Paul seeks to secure for the returning fugitive,
as well as the motives to which he appeals in order
to secure it, do shadow forth in no uncertain outline
our welcome from God, and the treasures of His
heart towards us, because they are at bottom the
same. The Epistle then is valuable, as showing in
a concrete instance how the Christian life, in its
attitude to others, and especially to those who have
injured us, is all modelled upon God&#8217;s forgiving love
to us. Our Lord&#8217;s parable of the forgiven servant
who took his brother by the throat finds here a
commentary, and the Apostle&#8217;s own precept, &ldquo;Be
imitators of God, and walk in love,&rdquo; a practical exemplification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Nor is the light which the letter throws on the
character of the Apostle to be regarded as unimportant.
The warmth, the delicacy, and what, if it
were not so spontaneous, we might call tact, the
graceful ingenuity with which he pleads for the
fugitive, the perfect courtesy of every word, the gleam
of playfulness&mdash;all fused together and harmonized to
one end, and that in so brief a compass and with
such unstudied ease and complete self-oblivion, make
this Epistle a pure gem. Without thought of effect,
and with complete unconsciousness, this man beats
all the famous letter-writers on their own ground.
That must have been a great intellect, and closely
conversant with the Fountain of all light and beauty,
which could shape the profound and far-reaching
teachings of the Epistle to the Colossians, and pass
from them to the graceful simplicity and sweet
kindliness of this exquisite letter; as if Michael
Angelo had gone straight from smiting his magnificent
Moses from the marble mass to incise some
delicate and tiny figure of Love or Friendship on a
cameo.</p>

<p>The structure of the letter is of the utmost
simplicity. It is not so much a structure as a flow.
There is the usual superscription and salutation,
followed, according to Paul&#8217;s custom, by the expression
of his thankful recognition of the love and
faith of Philemon and his prayer for the perfecting
of these. Then he goes straight to the business in
hand, and with incomparable persuasiveness pleads
for a welcome to Onesimus, bringing all possible
reasons to converge on that one request, with an
ingenious eloquence born of earnestness. Having
poured out his heart in this pleasure adds no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
but affectionate greetings from his companions and
himself.</p>

<p>In the present section we shall confine our attention
to the superscription and opening salutation.</p>

<p>I. We may observe the Apostle&#8217;s designation of
himself, as marked by consummate and instinctive
appreciation of the claims of friendship, and of his
own position in this letter as a suppliant. He does
not come to his friend clothed with apostolic
authority. In his letters to the Churches he always
puts that in the forefront, and when he expected to
be met by opponents, as in Galatia, there is a certain
ring of defiance in his claim to receive his commission
through no human intervention, but straight
from heaven. Sometimes, as in the Epistle to the
Colossians, he unites another strangely contrasted
title, and calls himself also &ldquo;the slave&rdquo; of Christ;
the one name asserting authority, the other bowing
in humility before his Owner and Master. But here
he is writing as a friend to a friend, and his object
is to win his friend to a piece of Christian conduct
which may be somewhat against the grain. Apostolic
authority will not go half so far as personal
influence in this case. So he drops all reference
to it, and, instead, lets Philemon hear the fetters
jangling on his limbs&mdash;a more powerful plea. &ldquo;Paul,
a prisoner,&rdquo; surely that would go straight to Philemon&#8217;s
heart, and give all but irresistible force to
the request which follows. Surely if he could do
anything to show his love and gratify even momentarily
his friend in prison, he would not refuse it. If
this designation had been calculated to produce effect,
it would have lost all its grace; but no one with
any ear for the accents of inartificial spontaneousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
can fail to hear them in the unconscious pathos of
these opening words, which say the right thing, all
unaware of how right it is.</p>

<p>There is great dignity also, as well as profound
faith, in the next words, in which the Apostle calls
himself a prisoner &ldquo;of Christ Jesus.&rdquo; With what
calm ignoring of all subordinate agencies he looks to
the true author of his captivity! Neither Jewish
hatred nor Roman policy had shut him up in Rome.
Christ Himself had riveted his manacles on his
wrists, therefore he bore them as lightly and proudly
as a bride might wear the bracelet that her husband
had clasped on her arm. The expression reveals both
the author of and the reason for his imprisonment,
and discloses the conviction which held him up in it.
He thinks of his Lord as the Lord of providence,
whose hand moves the pieces on the board&mdash;Pharisees,
and Roman governors, and guards, and Cæsar;
and he knows that he is an ambassador in bonds,
for no crime, but for the testimony of Jesus. We
need only notice that his younger companion
Timothy is associated with the Apostle in the superscription,
but disappears at once. The reason for
the introduction of his name may either have been
the slight additional weight thereby given to the
request of the letter, or more probably, the additional
authority thereby given to the junior, who would, in
all likelihood, have much of Paul&#8217;s work devolved
on him when Paul was gone.</p>

<p>The names of the receivers of the letter bring
before us a picture seen, as by one glimmering light
across the centuries, of a Christian household in that
Phrygian valley. The head of it, Philemon, appears
to have been a native of, or at all events a resident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in, Colossæ; for Onesimus, his slave, is spoken of in
the Epistle to the Church there as &ldquo;one of <i>you</i>.&rdquo; He
was a person of some standing and wealth, for he
had a house large enough to admit of a &ldquo;Church&rdquo;
assembling in it, and to accommodate the Apostle and
his travelling companions if he should visit Colossæ.
He had apparently the means for large pecuniary
help to poor brethren, and willingness to use them,
for we read of the refreshment which his kindly
deeds had imparted. He had been one of Paul&#8217;s
converts, and owed his own self to him; so that he
must have met the Apostle,&mdash;who had probably not
been in Colossæ,&mdash;on some of his journeys, perhaps
during his three years&#8217; residence in Ephesus. He
was of mature years, if, as is probable, Archippus,
who was old enough to have service to do in the
Church (Col. iv. 17), was his son.</p>

<p>He is called &ldquo;our fellow-labourer.&rdquo; The designation
may imply some actual co-operation at a
former time. But more probably, the phrase, like
the similar one in the next verse, &ldquo;our fellow-soldier,&rdquo;
is but Paul&#8217;s gracefully affectionate way of lifting
these good people&#8217;s humbler work out of its narrowness,
by associating it with his own. They in their
little sphere, and he in his wider, were workers at
the same task. All who toil for furtherance of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, however widely they may be
parted by time or distance, are fellow-workers.
Division of labour does not impair unity of service.
The field is wide, and the months between seedtime
and harvest are long; but all the husbandmen have
been engaged in the same great work, and though
they have toiled alone shall &ldquo;rejoice together.&rdquo;
The first man who dug a shovelful of earth for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
foundations of Cologne Cathedral, and he who fixed
the last stone on the topmost spire a thousand years
after, are fellow-workers. So Paul and Philemon,
though their tasks were widely different in kind, in
range, and in importance, and were carried on apart
and independent of each other, were fellow-workers.
The one lived a Christian life and helped some
humble saints in an insignificant, remote corner;
the other flamed through the whole then civilized
western world, and sheds light to-day: but the
obscure, twinkling taper and the blazing torch were
kindled at the same source, shone with the same
light, and were parts of one great whole. Our
narrowness is rebuked, our despondency cheered,
our vulgar tendency to think little of modest, obscure
service rendered by commonplace people, and to
exaggerate the worth of the more conspicuous, is
corrected by such a thought. However small may
be our capacity or sphere, and however solitary we
may feel, we may summon up before the eyes of our
faith a mighty multitude of apostles, martyrs, toilers
in every land and age as <i>our</i>&mdash;even our&mdash;work-fellows.
The field stretches far beyond our vision,
and many are toiling in it for Him, whose work
never comes near ours. There are differences of
service, but the same Lord, and all who have the
same master are companions in labour. Therefore
Paul, the greatest of the servants of Christ, reaches
down his hand to the obscure Philemon, and says,
&ldquo;He works the work of the Lord, as I also do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the house at Colossæ there was a Christian
wife by the side of a Christian husband; at least,
the mention of Apphia here in so prominent a position
is most naturally accounted for by supposing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
to be the wife of Philemon. Her friendly reception
of the runaway would be quite as important as his,
and it is therefore most natural that the letter bespeaking
it should be addressed to both. The
probable reading &ldquo;our sister&rdquo; (R.V.), instead of
&ldquo;our beloved&rdquo; (A.V.), gives the distinct assurance
that she too was a Christian, and like-minded with
her husband.</p>

<p>The prominent mention of this Phrygian matron
is an illustration of the way in which Christianity,
without meddling with social usages, introduced a
new tone of feeling about the position of woman,
which gradually changed the face of the world, is
still working, and has further revolutions to affect.
The degraded classes of the Greek world were slaves
and women. This Epistle touches both, and shows
us Christianity in the very act of elevating both.
The same process strikes the fetters from the slave
and sets the wife by the side of the husband, &ldquo;yoked
in all exercise of noble end,&rdquo;&mdash;namely, the proclamation
of Christ as the Saviour of all mankind,
and of all human creatures as equally capable of
receiving an equal salvation. That annihilates all
distinctions. The old world was parted by deep
gulfs. There were three of special depth and width,
across which it was hard for sympathy to fly.
These were the distinctions of race, sex, and condition.
But the good news that Christ has died for
all men, and is ready to live in all men, has thrown a
bridge across, or rather has filled up, the ravine; so
the Apostle bursts into his triumphant proclamation,
&ldquo;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither
bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for
ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
A third name is united with those of husband and
wife, that of Archippus. The close relation in which
the names stand, and the purely domestic character
of the letter, make it probable that he was a son of
the wedded pair. At all events, he was in some
way part of their household, possibly some kind of
teacher and guide. We meet his name also in the
Epistle to the Colossians, and, from the nature of
the reference to him there, we draw the inference
that he filled some &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; in the Church of
Laodicea. The nearness of the two cities made it
quite possible that he should live in Philemon&#8217;s
house in Colossæ and yet go over to Laodicea for
his work.</p>

<p>The Apostle calls him &ldquo;his fellow-soldier,&rdquo; a
phrase which is best explained in the same fashion
as is the previous &ldquo;fellow-worker,&rdquo; namely, that by
it Paul graciously associates Archippus with himself,
different as their tasks were. The variation of
<i>soldier</i> for <i>worker</i> probably is due to the fact of
Archippus&#8217; being the bishop of the Laodicean Church.
In any case, it is very beautiful that the grizzled
veteran officer should thus, as it were, clasp the hand
of this young recruit, and call him his comrade.
How it would go to the heart of Archippus!</p>

<p>A somewhat stern message is sent to Archippus
in the Colossian letter. Why did not Paul send it
quietly in this Epistle instead of letting a whole
Church know of it? It seems at first sight as if he
had chosen the harshest way; but perhaps further
consideration may suggest that the reason was an
instinctive unwillingness to introduce a jarring note
into the joyous friendship and confidence which
sounds through this Epistle, and to bring public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
matters into this private communication. The warning
would come with more effect from the Church,
and this cordial message of goodwill and confidence
would prepare Archippus to receive the other, as
rain showers make the ground soft for the good
seed. The private affection would mitigate the
public exhortation with whatever rebuke may have
been in it.</p>

<p>A greeting is sent, too, to &ldquo;the Church in thy
house.&rdquo; As in the case of the similar community
in the house of Nymphas (Col. iv. 15), we cannot
decide whether by this expression is meant simply a
Christian family, or some little company of believers
who were wont to meet beneath Philemon&#8217;s roof for
Christian converse and worship. The latter seems
the more probable supposition. It is natural that
they should be addressed; for Onesimus, if received
by Philemon, would naturally become a member of
the group, and therefore it was important to secure
their good will.</p>

<p>So we have here shown to us, by one stray beam
of twinkling light, for a moment, a very sweet
picture of the domestic life of that Christian household
in their remote valley. It shines still to us
across the centuries, which have swallowed up so
much that seemed more permanent, and silenced so
much that made far more noise in its day. The
picture may well set us asking ourselves the question
whether we, with all our boasted advancement, have
been able to realize the true ideal of Christian family
life as these three did. The husband and wife
dwelling as heirs together of the grace of life, their
child beside them sharing their faith and service,
their household ordered in the ways of the Lord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
their friends Christ&#8217;s friends, and their social joys
hallowed and serene&mdash;what nobler form of family
life can be conceived than that? What a rebuke
to, and satire on, many a so-called Christian household!</p>

<p>II. We may deal briefly with the apostolic salutation,
&ldquo;Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; as we have
already had to speak of it in considering the greeting
to the Colossians. The two main points to be
observed in these words are the comprehensiveness
of the Apostle&#8217;s loving wish, and the source to which
he looks for its fulfilment. Just as the regal title
of the King, whose Throne was the Cross, was
written in the languages of culture, of law, and of
religion, as an unconscious prophecy of His universal
reign; so, with like unintentional felicity, we have
blended here the ideals of good which the East and
the West have framed for those to whom they wish
good, in token that Christ is able to slake all the
thirsts of the soul, and that whatsoever things any
races of men have dreamed as the chiefest blessings,
these are all to be reached through Him and Him
only.</p>

<p>But the deeper lesson here is to be found by
observing that &ldquo;grace&rdquo; refers to the action of the
Divine heart, and &ldquo;peace&rdquo; to the result thereof in
man&#8217;s experience. As we have noted in commenting
on Col. i. 2, &ldquo;grace&rdquo; is free, undeserved, unmotived,
self-springing love. Hence it comes to
mean, not only the deep fountain in the Divine
nature, that His love, which, like some strong spring,
leaps up and gushes forth by an inward impulse, in
neglect of all motives drawn from the lovableness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
of its objects, such as determine our poor human
loves, but also the results of that bestowing love in
men&#8217;s characters, or, as we say, the &ldquo;graces&rdquo; of the
Christian soul. They are &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; not only because
in the æsthetic sense of the word they are beautiful,
but because, in the theological meaning of it, they
are the products of the giving love and power of
God. &ldquo;Whatsoever things are lovely and of good
report,&rdquo; all nobilities, tendernesses, exquisite beauties,
and steadfast strengths of mind and heart, of will
and disposition&mdash;all are the gifts of God&#8217;s undeserved
and open-handed love.</p>

<p>The fruit of such grace received is peace. In other
places the Apostle twice gives a fuller form of this
salutation, inserting &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; between the two here
named; as also does St. John in his second Epistle.
That fuller form gives us the source in the Divine
heart, the manifestation of grace in the Divine act,
and the outcome in human experience; or as we
may say, carrying on the metaphor, the broad, calm
lake which the grace, flowing to us in the stream
of mercy, makes, when it opens out in our hearts.
Here, however, we have but the ultimate source, and
the effect in us.</p>

<p>All the discords of our nature and circumstances
can be harmonized by that grace which is ready to
flow into our hearts. Peace with God, with ourselves,
with our fellows, repose in the midst of
change, calm in conflict, may be ours. All these
various applications of the one idea should be included
in our interpretation, for they are all included
in fact in the peace which God&#8217;s grace brings where
it lights. The first and deepest need of the soul is
conscious amity and harmony with God, and nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
but the consciousness of His love as forgiving and
healing brings that. We are torn asunder by conflicting
passions, and our hearts are the battleground
for conscience and inclination, sin and goodness,
hopes and fears, and a hundred other contending
emotions. Nothing but a heavenly power can make
the lion within lie down with the lamb. Our natures
are &ldquo;like the troubled sea, which cannot rest,&rdquo; whose
churning waters cast up the foul things that lie in
their slimy beds; but where God&#8217;s grace comes, a
great calm hushes the tempests, &ldquo;and birds of peace
sit brooding on the charmed wave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are compassed about by foes with whom we
have to wage undying warfare, and by hostile circumstances
and difficult tasks which need continual
conflict; but a man with God&#8217;s grace in his heart
may have the rest of submission, the repose of trust,
the tranquillity of him who &ldquo;has ceased from his
own works&rdquo;: and so, while the daily struggle goes
on and the battle rages round, there may be quiet,
deep and sacred, in his heart.</p>

<p>The life of nature, which is a selfish life, flings
us into unfriendly rivalries with others, and sets us
battling for our own hands, and it is hard to pass
out of ourselves sufficiently to live peaceably with
all men. But the grace of God in our hearts drives
out self, and changes the man who truly has it into
its own likeness. He who knows that he owes
everything to a Divine love which stooped to his
lowliness, and pardoned his sins, and enriched him
with all which he has that is worthy and noble,
cannot but move among men, doing with them, in
his poor fashion, what God has done with him.</p>

<p>Thus, in all the manifold forms in which restless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
hearts need peace, the grace of God brings it to
them. The great river of mercy which has its source
deep in the heart of God, and in His free, undeserved
love, pours into poor, unquiet spirits, and
there spreads itself into a placid lake, on whose still
surface all heaven is mirrored.</p>

<p>The elliptical form of this salutation leaves it
doubtful whether we are to see in it a prayer or a
prophecy, a wish or an assurance. According to
the probable reading of the parallel greeting in the
second Epistle of John, the latter would be the
construction; but probably it is best to combine
both ideas, and to see here, as Bengel does in the
passage referred to in John&#8217;s Epistle, &ldquo;votum cum
affirmatione&rdquo;&mdash;a desire which is so certain of its
own fulfilment, that it is a prophecy, just because it
is a prayer.</p>

<p>The ground of the certainty lies in the source
from which the grace and peace come. They flow
&ldquo;from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
The placing of both names under the government of
one preposition implies the mysterious unity of the
Father with the Son; while conversely St. John, in
the parallel passage just mentioned, by employing
two prepositions, brings out the distinction between
the Father, who is the fontal source, and the Son,
who is the flowing stream. But both forms of the
expression demand for their honest explanation the
recognition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. How
dare a man, who thought of Him as other than
Divine, put His name thus by the side of God&#8217;s, as
associated with the Father in the bestowal of grace?
Surely such words, spoken without any thought of
a doctrine of the Trinity, and which are the spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
utterance of Christian devotion, are demonstration,
not to be gainsaid, that to Paul, at all
events, Jesus Christ was, in the fullest sense, Divine.
The double source is one source, for in the Son is
the whole fulness of the Godhead; and the grace of
God, bringing with it the peace of God, is poured
into that spirit which bows humbly before Jesus
Christ, and trusts Him when He says, with love in
His eyes and comfort in His tones, &ldquo;My grace is
sufficient for thee&rdquo;; &ldquo;My peace give I unto you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord
Jesus, and toward all the saints; that the fellowship of thy faith may
become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you,

hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philem.</span>
4&ndash;7 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>Paul&#8217;s was one of those regal natures to which
things are possible that other men dare not do.
No suspicion of weakness attaches to him when he
pours out his heart in love, nor any of insincerity
when he speaks of his continual prayers for his
friends, or when he runs over in praise of his converts.
Few men have been able to talk so much of
their love without betraying its shallowness and self-consciousness,
or of their prayers without exciting
a doubt of their manly sincerity. But the Apostle
could venture to do these things without being
thought either feeble or false, and could unveil his
deepest affections and his most secret devotions
without provoking either a smile or a shrug.</p>

<p>He has the habit of beginning all his letters with
thankful commendations and assurances of a place
in his prayers. The exceptions are 2 Corinthians,
where he writes under strong and painful emotion,
and Galatians, where a vehement accusation of
fickleness takes the place of the usual greeting. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
these exceptions make the habit more conspicuous.
Though this is a habit, it is not a form, but the
perfectly simple and natural expression of the
moment&#8217;s feelings. He begins his letters so, not
in order to please and to say smooth things, but
because he feels lovingly, and his heart fills with
a pure joy which speaks most fitly in prayer. To
recognise good is the way to make good better.
Teachers must love if their teaching is to help.
The best way to secure the doing of any signal
act of Christian generosity, such as Paul wished of
Philemon, is to show absolute confidence that it will
be done, because it is in accordance with what we
know of the doer&#8217;s character. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a shame to tell
Arnold a lie: he always trusts us,&rdquo; the Rugby boys
used to say. Nothing could so powerfully have
swayed Philemon to grant Paul&#8217;s request, as Paul&#8217;s
graceful mention of his beneficence, which mention
is yet by no means conscious diplomacy, but instinctive
kindliness.</p>

<p>The words of this section are simple enough, but
their order is not altogether clear. They are a good
example of the hurry and rush of the Apostle&#8217;s style,
arising from his impetuosity of nature. His thoughts
and feelings come knocking at &ldquo;the door of his
lips&rdquo; in a crowd, and do not always make their way
out in logical order. For instance, he begins here
with thankfulness, and that suggests the mention
of his prayers, <i>v.</i> 4. Then he gives the occasion of
his thankfulness in <i>v.</i> 5, &ldquo;Hearing of thy love and
of the faith which thou hast,&rdquo; etc. He next tells
Philemon the subject matter of his prayers in <i>v.</i> 6,
&ldquo;That the fellowship of thy faith may become
effectual,&rdquo; etc. These two verses thus correspond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to the two clauses of <i>v.</i> 4, and finally in <i>v.</i> 7 he
harks back once more to his reasons for thankfulness
in Philemon&#8217;s love and faith, adding, in a very
lovely and pathetic way, that the good deeds done
in far off Colossæ had wafted a refreshing air to the
Roman prison house, and, little as the doer knew it,
had been a joy and comfort to the solitary prisoner
there.</p>

<p>I. We have,&mdash;then, here the character of Philemon,
which made Paul glad and thankful. The order
of the language is noteworthy. Love is put before
faith. The significance of this sequence comes out
by contrast with similar expressions in Ephesians i.
15: &ldquo;Your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto
all the saints&rdquo; (A.V.) and Colossians i. 4: &ldquo;Your
faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have
toward all the saints,&rdquo; where the same elements are
arranged in the more natural order, corresponding
to their logical relation; viz., faith first, and love
as its consequence. The reason for the change here
is probably that Onesimus and Epaphras, from
whom Paul would be likely to hear of Philemon,
would enlarge upon his practical benevolence, and
would naturally say less about the root than about
the sweet and visible fruit. The arrangement then
is an echo of the talks which had gladdened the
Apostle. Possibly, too, love is put first, because the
object of the whole letter is to secure its exercise
towards the fugitive slave; and seeing that the
Apostle would listen with that purpose in view, each
story which was told of Philemon&#8217;s kindness to
others made the deeper impression on Paul. The
order here is the order of analysis, digging down
from manifestation to cause: the order in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
parallel passages quoted is the order of production
ascending from root to flower.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity in the arrangement of the
words is that the objects of love and faith are named
in the reverse order to that in which these graces
are mentioned, &ldquo;the Lord Jesus&rdquo; being first, and
&ldquo;all the saints&rdquo; last. Thus we have, as it were,
&ldquo;faith towards the Lord Jesus&rdquo; imbedded in the
centre of the verse, while &ldquo;thy love ... toward
all the saints,&rdquo; which flows from it, wraps it round.
The arrangement is like some forms of Hebrew
poetical parallelism, in which the first and fourth
members correspond, and the second and third, or
like the pathetic measure of <i>In Memoriam</i>, and has
the same sweet lingering cadence; while it also
implies important truths as to the central place in
regard to the virtues which knit hearts in soft bonds
of love and help, of the faith which finds its sole
object in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The source and foundation of goodness and
nobility of character is faith in Jesus the Lord.
That must be buried deep in the soul if tender love
toward men is to flow from it. It is &ldquo;the very
pulse of the machine.&rdquo; All the pearls of goodness
are held in solution in faith. Or, to speak more
accurately, faith in Christ gives possession of His
life and Spirit, from which all good is unfolded;
and it further sets in action strong motives by which
to lead to every form of purity and beauty of soul;
and, still further, it brings the heart into glad contact
with a Divine love which forgives its Onesimuses,
and so it cannot but touch the heart into some
glad imitation of that love which is its own dearest
treasure. So that, for all these and many more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
reasons, love to men is the truest visible expression,
as it is the direct and necessary result, of faith in
Christ. What is exhaled from the heart and drawn
upwards by the fervours of Christ&#8217;s self-sacrificing
love is faith; when it falls on earth again, as a sweet
rain of pity and tenderness, it is love.</p>

<p>Further, the true object of faith and one phase of
its attitude towards that object are brought out in
this central clause. We have the two names which
express, the one the divinity, the other the humanity
of Christ. So the proper object of faith is the
whole Christ, in both His natures, the Divine-human
Saviour. Christian faith sees the divinity in the
humanity, and the humanity around the divinity.
A faith which grasps only the manhood is maimed,
and indeed has no right to the name. Humanity
is not a fit object of trust. It may change; it has
limits; it must die. &ldquo;Cursed be the man that
maketh flesh his arm,&rdquo; is as true about faith in a
merely human Christ as about faith in any other
man. There may be reverence, there may be in
some sense love, obedience, imitation; but there
should not be, and I see not how there can be,
the absolute reliance, the utter dependence, the
unconditional submission, which are of the very
essence of faith, in the emotions which men cherish
towards a human Christ. The Lord Jesus only can
evoke these. On the other hand, the far off splendour
and stupendous glory of the Divine nature becomes
the object of untrembling trust, and draws near
enough to be known and loved, when we have it
mellowed to our weak eyes by shining through the
tempering medium of His humanity.</p>

<p>The preposition here used to define the relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
of faith to its object is noteworthy. Faith is
&ldquo;toward&rdquo; Him. The idea is that of a movement
of yearning after an unattained good. And that is
one part of the true office of faith. There is in it
an element of aspiration, as of the soaring eagle to
the sun, or the climbing tendrils to the summit of
the supporting stem. In Christ there is always
something beyond, which discloses itself the more
clearly, the fuller is our present possession of Him.
Faith builds upon and rests in the Christ possessed
and experienced, and just therefore will it, if it be
true, yearn towards the Christ unpossessed. A
great reach of flashing glory beyond opens on us,
as we round each new headland in that unending
voyage. Our faith should and will be an ever-increasing
fruition of Christ, accompanied with increasing
perception of unreached depths in Him,
and increasing longing after enlarged possession of
His infinite fulness.</p>

<p>Where the centre is such a faith, its circumference
and outward expression will be a widely diffused
love. That deep and most private emotion of the
soul, which is the flight of the lonely spirit to the
single Christ, as if these two were alone in the world,
does not bar a man off from his kind, but effloresces
into the largest and most practical love. When one
point of the compasses is struck deeply and firmly
into that centre of all things, the other can steadily
sweep a wide circle. The widest is not here drawn,
but a somewhat narrower, concentric one. The love
is &ldquo;toward all saints.&rdquo; Clearly their relation to
Jesus Christ puts all Christians into relation with
one another. That was an astounding thought in
Philemon&#8217;s days, when such high walls separated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
race from race, the slave from the free, woman from
man; but the new faith leaped all barriers, and put
a sense of brotherhood into every heart that learned
God&#8217;s fatherhood in Jesus. The nave of the wheel
holds all the spokes in place. The sun makes the
system called by its name a unity, though some
planets be of giant bulk and swing through a mighty
orbit, waited on by obedient satellites, and some be
but specks and move through a narrow circle, and
some have scarce been seen by human eye. All
are one, because all revolve round one sun, though
solemn abysses part them, and though no message
has ever crossed the gulfs from one to another.</p>

<p>The recognition of the common relation which all
who bear the same relation to Christ bear to one
another has more formidable difficulties to encounter
to-day than it had in these times when the Church
had no stereotyped creeds and no stiffened organizations,
and when to the flexibility of its youth
were added the warmth of new conviction and the
joy of a new field for expanding emotions of
brotherly kindness. But nothing can absolve from
the duty. Creeds separate, Christ unites. The
road to &ldquo;the reunion of Christendom&rdquo; is through
closer union to Jesus Christ. When that is secured,
barriers which now keep brethren apart will be
leaped, or pulled down, or got rid of somehow. It
is of no use to say, &ldquo;Go to, let us love one another.&rdquo;
That will be unreal, mawkish, histrionic. &ldquo;The
faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus&rdquo; will
be the productive cause, as it is the measure, of
&ldquo;thy love toward all the saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the love which is here commended is not a
mere feeling, nor does it go off in gushes, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
fervid, of eloquent emotion. Clearly Philemon was
a benefactor of the brotherhood, and his love did
not spend only the paper money of words and
promises to pay, but the solid coin of kindly deeds.
Practical charity is plainly included in that love of
which it had cheered Paul in his imprisonment to
hear. Its mention, then, is one step nearer to the
object of the letter. Paul conducts his siege of
Philemon&#8217;s heart skilfully, and opens here a fresh
parallel, and creeps a yard or two closer up.
&ldquo;Surely you are not going to shut out one of your
own household from that wide-reaching kindness.&rdquo;
So much is most delicately hinted, or rather, left
to Philemon to infer, by the recognition of his
brotherly love. A hint lies in it that there may
be a danger of cherishing a cheap and easy charity
that reverses the law of gravity, and <i>in</i>creases as the
square of the distance, having tenderness and smiles
for people and Churches which are well out of our
road, and frowns for some nearer home. &ldquo;He
that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
how shall he love&rdquo; his brother &ldquo;whom he hath not
seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. In <i>v.</i> 6 we have the apostolic prayer for
Philemon, grounded on the tidings of his love and
faith. It is immediately connected with &ldquo;the
prayers&rdquo; of <i>v.</i> 4 by the introductory &ldquo;that,&rdquo; which
is best understood as introducing the subject matter
of the prayer. Whatever then may be the meaning
of this supplication, it is a prayer for Philemon, and
not for others. That remark disposes of the explanations
which widen its scope, contrary, as it
seems to me, to the natural understanding of the
context.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
&ldquo;The fellowship of thy faith&rdquo; is capable of more
than one meaning. The signification of the principal
word and the relation expressed by the preposition
may be variously determined. &ldquo;Fellowship&rdquo; is more
than once used in the sense of sharing material
wealth with Christ&#8217;s poor, or more harshly and
plainly, charitable contribution. So we find it in
Romans xv. 26 and 2 Corinthians ix. 13. Adopting
that meaning here, the &ldquo;of&rdquo; must express, as
it often does, the origin of Philemon&#8217;s kindly gifts,
namely, his faith; and the whole phrase accords
with the preceding verse in its view of the genesis of
beneficence to the brethren as the result of faith in
the Lord.</p>

<p>The Apostle prays that this faith-begotten practical
liberality may become efficacious, or may acquire
still more power; <i>i.e.</i> may increase in activity, and
so may lead to &ldquo;the knowledge of every good thing
that is in us.&rdquo; The interpretation has found extensive
support, which takes this as equivalent to
a desire that Philemon&#8217;s good deeds might lead
others, whether enemies or friends, to recognise the
beauties of sympathetic goodness in the true Christian
character. Such an explanation hopelessly
confuses the whole, and does violence to the plain
requirements of the context, which limit the prayer
to Philemon. It is <i>his</i> &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of which Paul
is thinking. The same profound and pregnant word
is used here which occurs so frequently in the other
epistles of the captivity, and which always means
that deep and vital knowledge which knows because
it possesses. Usually its object is God as revealed
in the great work and person of Christ. Here its
object is the sum total of spiritual blessings, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
whole fulness of the gifts given us by, and, at bottom,
consisting of, that same Christ dwelling in the heart,
who is revealer, because He is communicator, of
God. The full, deep knowledge of this manifold
and yet one good is no mere theoretical work of the
understanding, but is an experience which is only
possible to him who enjoys it.</p>

<p>The meaning of the whole prayer, then, put into
feebler and more modern dress is simply that
Philemon&#8217;s liberality and Christian love may grow
more and more, and may help him to a fuller appropriation
and experience of the large treasures &ldquo;which
are in us,&rdquo; though in germ and potentiality only,
until brought into consciousness by our own Christian
growth. The various readings &ldquo;in us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in
you&rdquo; only widen the circle of possessors of these
gifts to the whole Church, or narrow it to the
believers of Colossæ.</p>

<p>There still remain for consideration the last words
of the clause, &ldquo;unto Christ&rdquo; They must be referred
back to the main subject of the sentence, &ldquo;may
become effectual.&rdquo; They seem to express the condition
on which Christian &ldquo;fellowship,&rdquo; like all
Christian acts, can be quickened with energy, and
tend to spiritual progress; namely, that it shall be
done as to the Lord. There is perhaps in this
appended clause a kind of lingering echo of our
Lord&#8217;s own words, in which He accepts as done
unto Him the kindly deeds done to the least of His
brethren.</p>

<p>So then this great prayer brings out very strongly
the goal to which the highest perfection of Christian
character has still to aspire. Philemon was no
weakling or laggard in the Christian conflict and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
race. His attainments sent a thrill of thankfulness
through the Apostle&#8217;s spirit. But there remained
&ldquo;very much land to be possessed&rdquo;; and precisely
because he had climbed so far, does his friend pray
that he may mount still higher, where the sweep
of view is wider, and the air clearer still. It is an
endless task to bring into conscious possession and
exercise all the fulness with which Christ endows
His feeblest servant. Not till all that God can give,
or rather has given, has been incorporated in the
nature and wrought out in the life, is the term
reached. This is the true sublime of the Christian
life, that it begins with the reception of a strictly
infinite gift, and demands immortality as the field
for unfolding its worth. Continual progress in all
that ennobles the nature, satisfies the heart, and
floods the mind with light is the destiny of the
Christian soul, and of it alone. Therefore unwearied
effort, buoyancy, and hope which no dark memories
can dash nor any fears darken should mark <i>their</i>
temper, to whom the future offers an absolutely endless
and limitless increase in the possession of the
infinite God.</p>

<p>There is also brought out in this prayer the value
of Christian beneficence as a means of spiritual
growth. Philemon&#8217;s &ldquo;communication of faith&rdquo; will
help him to the knowledge of the fulness of Christ.
The reaction of conduct on character and growth in
godliness is a familiar idea with Paul, especially in
the prison epistles. Thus we read in his prayer for
the Colossians, &ldquo;fruitful in every good work, and
increasing in the knowledge of God.&rdquo; The faithful
carrying out in life of what we already know is not
the least important condition of increasing knowledge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
If a man does not live up to his religion, his religion
shrinks to the level of his life. Unoccupied territory
lapses. We hold our spiritual gifts on the terms
of using them. The practice of convictions deepens
convictions; not that the exercise of Christian graces
will make theologians, but it will give larger possession
of the knowledge which is life.</p>

<p>While this general principle is abundantly enforced
in Scripture and confirmed by experience, the specific
form of it here is that the right administration of
wealth is a direct means of increasing a Christian&#8217;s
possession of the large store treasured in Christ.
Every loving thought towards the sorrowful and the
needy, every touch of sympathy yielded to, and
every kindly, Christlike deed flowing from these,
thins away some film of the barriers between the
believing soul and a full possession of God, and thus
makes it more capable of beholding Him and of
rising to communion with Him. The possibilities
of wealth lie, not only in the direction of earthly
advantages, but in the fact that men may so use it
as to secure their being &ldquo;received into everlasting
habitations.&rdquo; Modern evangelical teachers have been
afraid to say what Paul ventured to say on this
matter, for fear of obscuring the truth which Paul
gave his life to preach. Surely they need not be
more jealous for the doctrine of &ldquo;justification by
faith&rdquo; than he was; and if he had no scruples in
telling rich men to &ldquo;lay up in store for themselves
a good foundation for the time to come,&rdquo; by being
&ldquo;ready to communicate,&rdquo; they may safely follow.
There is probably no more powerful cause of the
comparative feebleness of average English Christianity
than the selfish use of money, and no surer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
means of securing a great increase in the depth and
richness of the individual Christian life than the
fuller application of Christian principle, that is, of
the law of sacrifice, to the administration of property.</p>

<p>The final clause of the verse seems to state the
condition on which Philemon&#8217;s good deeds will avail
for his own growth in grace, and implies that in him
that condition is fulfilled. If a man does deeds of
kindness and help to one of these little ones, as
&ldquo;unto Christ,&rdquo; then his beneficence will come back
in spiritual blessing on his own head. If they are
the result of simple natural compassion, beautiful as
it is, they will reinforce <i>it</i>, but have no tendency to
strengthen that from which they do <i>not</i> flow. If
they are tainted by any self-regard, then they are
not charitable deeds at all. What is done for Christ
will bring to the doer more of Christ as its consequence
and reward. All life, with all its varied
forms of endurance and service, comes under this
same law, and tends to make more assured and more
blessed and more profound the knowledge and grasp
of the fulness of Christ, in the measure in which it is
directed to Him, and done or suffered for His sake.</p>

<p>III. The present section closes with a very sweet
and pathetic representation of the Apostle&#8217;s joy in
the character of his friend.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;for&rdquo; of <i>v.</i> 7 connects not with the words of
petition immediately before, but with &ldquo;I thank my
God&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 4), and gives a graceful turn&mdash;graceful
only because so unforced and true&mdash;to the sentence.
&ldquo;My thanks are due to you for your kindness to
others, for, though you did not think of it, you have
done me as much good as you did them.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;love&rdquo; which gives Paul such &ldquo;great joy and consolation&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
is not love directed to himself, but to others;
and the reason why it gladdened the Apostle was
because it had &ldquo;refreshed the hearts&rdquo; of sorrowful
and needy saints in Colossæ. This tender expression
of affectionate joy in Philemon&#8217;s good deeds
is made wonderfully emotional by that emphatic
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; which ends the verse, and by its unusual
position in the sentence assumes the character of
a sudden, irrepressible shoot of love from Paul&#8217;s
heart towards Philemon, like the quick impulse with
which a mother will catch up her child, and cover it
with caresses. Paul was never ashamed of showing
his tenderness, and it never repels us.</p>

<p>These final words suggest the unexpected good
which good deeds may do. No man can ever tell
how far the blessing of his trivial acts of kindness,
or other pieces of Christian conduct, may travel.
They may benefit one in material fashion, but the
fragrance may reach many others. Philemon little
dreamed that his small charity to some suffering
brother in Colossæ would find its way across the sea,
and bring a waft of coolness and refreshing into the
hot prison house. Neither Paul nor Philemon
dreamed that, made immortal by the word of the
former, the same transient act would find its way
across the centuries, and would &ldquo;smell sweet and
blossom in the dust&rdquo; to-day. Men know not who
are their audiences, or who may be spectators of
their works; for they are all bound so mystically and
closely together, that none can tell how far the
vibrations which he sets in motion will thrill. This
is true about all deeds, good and bad, and invests
them all with solemn importance. The arrow shot
travels beyond the archer&#8217;s eye, and may wound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
where he knows not. The only thing certain about
the deed once done is, that its irrevocable consequences
will reach much farther than the doer dreamed, and
that no limits can be set to the subtle influence
which, for blessing or harm, it exerts.</p>

<p>Since the diameter of the circle which our acts
may fill is unknown and unknowable, the doer who
stands at the centre is all the more solemnly bound
to make sure of the only thing of which he can
make sure, the quality of the influence sent forth;
and since his deed may blight or bless so widely, to
clarify his motives and guard his doings, that they
may bring only good wherever they light.</p>

<p>May we not venture to see shining through the
Apostle&#8217;s words the Master&#8217;s face? &ldquo;Even as Christ
did for us with God the Father,&rdquo; says Luther, &ldquo;thus
also doth St. Paul for Onesimus with Philemon&rdquo;;
and that thought may permissibly be applied to
many parts of this letter, to which it gives much
beauty. It may not be all fanciful to say that, as
Paul&#8217;s heart was gladdened when he heard of the
good deeds done in far-off Colossæ by a man who
&ldquo;owed to him his own self&rdquo; so we may believe that
Christ is glad and has &ldquo;great joy in our love&rdquo; to
His servants and in our kindliness, when He beholds
the poor work done by the humblest for His sake.
He sees and rejoices, and approves when there are
none but Himself to know or praise; and at last
many, who did lowly service to His friends, will be
surprised to hear from His lips the acknowledgment
that it was Himself whom they had visited and
succoured, and that they had been ministering to the
Master&#8217;s joy when they had only known themselves
to be succouring His servants&#8217; need.</p>

<h2><a name="PhilIII" id="PhilIII"></a>III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that
which is befitting, yet for love&#8217;s sake I rather beseech, being such a one
as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ; I beseech
thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus; who
was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee, and to
me.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philem.</span> 8&ndash;11 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>After honest and affectionate praise of Philemon,
the Apostle now approaches the main
purpose of his letter. But even now he does not
blurt it out at once. He probably anticipated that
his friend was justly angry with his runaway slave,
and therefore, in these verses, he touches a kind of
prelude to his request with what we should call the
finest tact, if it were not so manifestly the unconscious
product of simple good feeling. Even by
the end of them he has not ventured to say what he
wishes done, though he has ventured to introduce
the obnoxious name. So much persuading and
sanctified ingenuity does it sometimes take to induce
good men to do plain duties which may be unwelcome.</p>

<p>These verses not only present a model for efforts
to lead men in right paths, but they unveil the very
spirit of Christianity in their pleadings. Paul&#8217;s
persuasives to Philemon are echoes of Christ&#8217;s
persuasives to Paul. He had learned his method
from his Master, and had himself experienced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
gentle love was more than commandments. Therefore
he softens his voice to speak to Philemon, as
Christ had softened His to speak to Paul. We do
not arbitrarily &ldquo;spiritualize&rdquo; the words, but simply
recognise that the Apostle moulded his conduct
after Christ&#8217;s pattern, when we see here a mirror
reflecting some of the highest truths of Christian
ethics.</p>

<p>I. Here is seen love which beseeches where it
might command. The first word, &ldquo;wherefore,&rdquo;
leads back to the preceding sentence, and makes
Philemon&#8217;s past kindness to the saints the reason
for his being asked to be kind now. The Apostle&#8217;s
confidence in his friend&#8217;s character, and in his being
amenable to the appeal of love, made Paul waive his
apostolic authority, and sue instead of commanding.
There are people, like the horse and the mule, who
understand only rough imperatives, backed by force;
but they are fewer than we are apt to think, and
perhaps gentleness is never wholly thrown away.
No doubt, there must be adaptation of method to
different characters, but we should try gentleness
before we make up our minds that to try it is to
throw pearls before swine.</p>

<p>The careful limits put to apostolic authority here
deserve notice. &ldquo;I might be much bold in Christ to
command.&rdquo; He has no authority in himself, but he
has &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; His own personality gives him
none, but his relation to his Master does. It is a
distinct assertion of right to command, and an
equally distinct repudiation of any such right, except
as derived from his union with Jesus.</p>

<p>He still further limits his authority by that noteworthy
clause, &ldquo;that which is befitting.&rdquo; His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
authority does not stretch so far as to create new
obligations, or to repeal plain laws of duty. There
was a standard by which his commands were to be
tried. He appeals to Philemon&#8217;s own sense of moral
fitness, to his natural conscience, enlightened by
communion with Christ.</p>

<p>Then comes the great motive which he will urge,
&ldquo;for love&#8217;s sake,&rdquo;&mdash;not merely his to Philemon, nor
Philemon&#8217;s to him, but the bond which unites all
Christian souls together, and binds them all to
Christ. &ldquo;That grand, sacred principle,&rdquo; says Paul,
&ldquo;bids me put away authority, and speak in entreaty.&rdquo;
Love naturally beseeches, and does not order. The
harsh voice of command is simply the imposition of
another&#8217;s will, and it belongs to relationships in
which the heart has no share. But wherever love
is the bond, grace is poured into the lips, and &ldquo;I
enjoin&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;I pray.&rdquo; So that even where the
outward form of authority is still kept, as in a
parent to young children, there will ever be some
endearing word to swathe the harsh imperative in
tenderness, like a sword blade wrapped about with
wool, lest it should wound. Love tends to obliterate
the hard distinction of superior and inferior, which
finds its expression in laconic imperatives and silent
obedience. It seeks not for mere compliance with
commands, but for oneness of will. The lightest
wish breathed by loved lips is stronger than all stern
injunctions, often, alas! than all laws of duty. The
heart is so tuned as only to vibrate to that one tone.
The rocking stones, which all the storms of winter
may howl round and not move, can be set swinging
by a light touch. Una leads the lion in a silken
leash. Love controls the wildest nature. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
demoniac, whom no chains can bind, is found sitting
at the feet of incarnate gentleness. So the wish
of love is all-powerful with loving hearts, and its
faintest whisper louder and more constraining than
all the trumpets of Sinai.</p>

<p>There is a large lesson here for all human relationships.
Fathers and mothers, husbands and
wives, friends and companions, teachers and guides
of all sorts, should set their conduct by this pattern,
and let the law of love sit ever upon their lips.
Authority is the weapon of a weak man, who is
doubtful of his own power to get himself obeyed, or
of a selfish one, who seeks for mechanical submission
rather than for the fealty of willing hearts. Love is
the weapon of a strong man who can cast aside the
trappings of superiority, and is never loftier than
when he descends, nor more absolute than when
he abjures authority, and appeals with love to
love. Men are not to be dragooned into goodness.
If mere outward acts are sought, it may be enough
to impose another&#8217;s will in orders as curt as a
soldier&#8217;s word of command; but if the joyful inclination
of the heart to the good deed is to be secured,
that can only be done when law melts into love, and is
thereby transformed to a more imperative obligation,
written not on tables of stone, but on fleshy tables of
the heart.</p>

<p>There is a glimpse here into the very heart of
Christ&#8217;s rule over men. He too does not merely
impose commands, but stoops to entreat, where He
indeed might command. &ldquo;Henceforth I call you
not servants, but friends&rdquo;; and though He does go
on to say, &ldquo;Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you,&rdquo; yet His commandment has in it so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
much tenderness, condescension, and pleading love,
that it sounds far liker beseeching than enjoining.
His yoke is easy, for this among other reasons, that
it is, if one may so say, padded with love. His
burden is light, because it is laid on His servant&#8217;s
shoulders by a loving hand; and so, as St. Bernard
says, it is <i>onus quod portantem portat</i>, a burden which
carries him who carries it.</p>

<p>II. There is in these verses the appeal which
gives weight to the entreaties of love. The Apostle
brings personal considerations to bear on the enforcement
of impersonal duty, and therein follows
the example of his Lord. He presents his own circumstances
as adding power to his request, and as it
were puts himself into the scale. He touches with
singular pathos on two things which should sway
his friend. &ldquo;Such a one as Paul the aged.&rdquo; The
alternative rendering &ldquo;ambassador,&rdquo; while quite possible,
has not congruity in its favour, and would be
a recurrence to that very motive of official authority
which he has just disclaimed. The other rendering
is every way preferable. How old was he? Probably
somewhere about sixty&mdash;not a very great age,
but life was somewhat shorter then than now, and
Paul was, no doubt, aged by work, by worry, and by
the unresting spirit that &ldquo;o&#8217;er-informed his tenement
of clay.&rdquo; Such temperaments as his soon grow old.
Perhaps Philemon was not much younger; but the
prosperous Colossian gentleman had had a smoother
life, and, no doubt, carried his years more lightly.</p>

<p>The requests of old age should have weight. In
our days, what with the improvements in education,
and the general loosening of the bonds of reverence,
the old maxim that &ldquo;the utmost respect is due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
children,&rdquo; receives a strange interpretation, and in
many a household the Divine order is turned upside
down, and the juniors regulate all things. Other
still more sacred things will be likely to lose their
due reverence when silver hairs no longer receive
theirs.</p>

<p>But usually the aged who are &ldquo;such&rdquo; aged &ldquo;as
Paul&rdquo; was, will not fail of obtaining honour and
deference. No more beautiful picture of the bright
energy and freshness still possible to the old was
ever painted than may be gathered from the
Apostle&#8217;s unconscious sketch of himself. He delighted
in having young life about him&mdash;Timothy,
Titus, Mark, and others, boys in comparison with
himself, whom yet he admitted to close intimacy
as some old general might the youths of his staff,
warming his age at the genial flame of their growing
energies and unworn hopes. His was a joyful old
age too, notwithstanding many burdens of anxiety
and sorrow. We hear the clear song of his gladness
ringing through the epistle of joy, that to the Philippians,
which, like this, dates from his Roman captivity.
A Christian old age should be joyful, and only it will
be; for the joys of the natural life burn low, when
the fuel that fed them is nearly exhausted, and
withered hands are held in vain over the dying
embers. But Christ&#8217;s joy &ldquo;remains,&rdquo; and a Christian
old age may be like the polar midsummer days,
when the sun shines till midnight, and dips but for
an imperceptible interval ere it rises for the unending
day of heaven.</p>

<p>Paul the aged was full of interest in the things of
the day; no mere &ldquo;praiser of time gone by,&rdquo; but a
strenuous worker, cherishing a quick sympathy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
an eager interest which kept him young to the end.
Witness that last chapter of the second Epistle to
Timothy, where he is seen, in the immediate expectation
of death, entering heartily into passing
trifles, and thinking it worth while to give little
pieces of information about the movements of his
friends, and wishful to get his books and parchments,
that he might do some more work while waiting for
the headsman&#8217;s sword. And over his cheery, sympathetic,
busy old age there is thrown the light of a
great hope, which kindles desire and onward looks in
his dim eyes, and parts &ldquo;such a one as Paul the
aged&rdquo; by a whole universe from the old whose future
is dark and their past dreary, whose hope is a
phantom and their memory a pang.</p>

<p>The Apostle adds yet another personal characteristic
as a motive with Philemon to grant his request:
&ldquo;Now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus.&rdquo; He has
already spoken of himself in these terms in <i>v.</i> 1.
His sufferings were imposed by and endured for
Christ. He holds up his fettered wrist, and in effect
says, &ldquo;Surely you will not refuse anything that you
can do to wrap a silken softness round the cold, hard
iron, especially when you remember for Whose sake
and by Whose will I am bound with this chain.&rdquo;
He thus brings personal motives to reinforce duty
which is binding from other and higher considerations.
He does not merely tell Philemon that he
ought to take back Onesimus as a piece of self-sacrificing
Christian duty. He does imply that
highest motive throughout his pleadings, and urges
that such action is &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; or in consonance with
the position and obligations of a Christian man.
But he backs up this highest reason with these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
others: &ldquo;If you hesitate to take him back because
you ought, will you do it because I ask you? and,
before you answer that question, will you remember
my age, and what I am bearing for the Master?&rdquo;
If he can get his friend to do the right thing by the
help of these subsidiary motives, still, it is the right
thing; and the appeal to these motives will do Philemon
no harm, and, if successful, will do both him
and Onesimus a great deal of good.</p>

<p>Does not this action of Paul remind us of the
highest example of a similar use of motives of
personal attachment as aids to duty? Christ does
thus with His servants. He does not simply hold
up before us a cold law of duty, but warms it by
introducing our personal relation to Him as the main
motive for keeping it. Apart from Him, Morality
can only point to the tables of stone and say:
&ldquo;There! that is what you ought to do. Do it, or
face the consequences.&rdquo; But Christ says: &ldquo;I have
given Myself for you. My will is your law. Will
you do it for My sake?&rdquo; Instead of the chilling,
statuesque ideal, as pure as marble and as cold, a
Brother stands before us with a heart that beats, a
smile on His face, a hand outstretched to help; and
His word is, &ldquo;If ye love Me, keep My commandments.&rdquo;
The specific difference of Christian morality
lies not in its precepts, but in its motive, and in its
gift of power to obey. Paul could only urge regard
to him as a subsidiary inducement. Christ puts it
as the chief, nay, as the sole motive for obedience.</p>

<p>III. The last point suggested by these verses is
the gradual opening up of the main subject matter
of the Apostle&#8217;s request. Very noteworthy is the
tenderness of the description of the fugitive as &ldquo;my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
child, whom I have begotten in my bonds.&rdquo; Paul
does not venture to name him at once, but prepares
the way by the warmth of this affectionate reference.
The position of the name in the sentence is most
unusual, and suggests a kind of hesitation to take
the plunge, while the hurried passing on to meet the
objection which he knew would spring immediately
to Philemon&#8217;s mind is almost as if Paul laid his
hand on his friend&#8217;s lips to stop his words,&mdash;&ldquo;Onesimus
then is it? that good-for-nothing!&rdquo; Paul
admits the indictment, will say no word to mitigate
the condemnation due to his past worthlessness, but,
with a playful allusion to the slave&#8217;s name, which
conceals his deep earnestness, assures Philemon that
he will find the formerly inappropriate name,
Onesimus&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> profitable&mdash;true yet, for all that is
past. He is sure of this, because he, Paul, has
proved his value. Surely never were the natural
feelings of indignation and suspicion more skilfully
soothed, and never did repentant good-for-nothing
get sent back to regain the confidence which he
had forfeited, with such a certificate of character in
his hand!</p>

<p>But there is something of more importance than
Paul&#8217;s inborn delicacy and tact to notice here.
Onesimus had been a bad specimen of a bad class.
Slavery must needs corrupt both the owner and the
chattel; and, as a matter of fact, we have classical
allusions enough to show that the slaves of Paul&#8217;s
period were deeply tainted with the characteristic
vices of their condition. Liars, thieves, idle, treacherous,
nourishing a hatred of their masters all the more
deadly that it was smothered, but ready to flame
out, if opportunity served, in blood-curdling cruelties&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
constituted an ever-present danger, and
needed an ever-wakeful watchfulness. Onesimus
had been known to Philemon only as one of the
idlers who were more of a nuisance than a benefit,
and cost more than they earned; and he apparently
ended his career by theft. And this degraded
creature, with scars on his soul deeper and worse
than the marks of fetters on his limbs, had somehow
found his way to the great jungle of a city, where all
foul vermin could crawl and hiss and sting with comparative
safety. There he had somehow come across
the Apostle, and had received into his heart, filled
with ugly desires and lusts, the message of Christ&#8217;s
love, which had swept it clean, and made him over
again. The Apostle has had but short experience
of his convert, but he is quite sure that he is a
Christian; and, that being the case, he is as sure
that all the bad black past is buried, and that the
new leaf now turned over will be covered with fair
writing, not in the least like the blots that were on
the former page, and have now been dissolved from
off it, by the touch of Christ&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p>It is a typical instance of the miracles which the
gospel wrought as every-day events in its transforming
career. Christianity knows nothing of
hopeless cases. It professes its ability to take the
most crooked stick and bring it straight, to flash a
new power into the blackest carbon, which will turn
it into a diamond. Every duty will be done better
by a man if he have the love and grace of Jesus
Christ in his heart. New motives are brought into
play, new powers are given, new standards of duty
are set up. The small tasks become great, and the
unwelcome sweet, and the difficult easy, when done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
for and through Christ. Old vices are crushed in their
deepest source; old habits driven out by the force
of a new affection, as the young leaf-buds push the
withered foliage from the tree. Christ can make
any man over again, and does so re-create every
heart that trusts to him. Such miracles of transformation
are wrought to-day as truly as of old.
Many professing Christians experience little of that
quickening and revolutionising energy; many observers
see little of it, and some begin to croak, as
if the old power had ebbed away. But wherever
men give the gospel fair play in their lives, and
open their spirits, in truth and not merely in profession,
to its influence, it vindicates its undiminished
possession of all its former energy; and if ever
it seems to fail, it is not that the medicine is
ineffectual, but that the sick man has not really
taken it. The low tone of much modern Christianity
and its dim exhibition of the transforming
power of the gospel is easily and sadly accounted
for without charging decrepitude on that which was
once so mighty, by the patent fact that much
modern Christianity is little better than lip acknowledgment,
and that much more of it is wofully
unfamiliar with the truth which it in some fashion
believes, and is sinfully negligent of the spiritual
gifts which it professes to treasure. If a Christian
man does not show that his religion is changing
him into the fair likeness of his Master, and fitting
him for all relations of life, the reason is simply that
he has so little of it, and that little so mechanical
and tepid.</p>

<p>Paul pleads with Philemon to take back his
worthless servant, and assures him that he will find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Onesimus helpful now. Christ does not need to be
besought to welcome His runaway good-for-nothings,
however unprofitable they have been. That Divine
charity of His forgives all things, and &ldquo;hopes all
things&rdquo; of the worst, and can fulfil its own hope in
the most degraded. With bright, unfaltering confidence
in His own power He fronts the most evil,
sure that He can cleanse; and that, no matter
what the past has been, His power can overcome
all defects of character, education, or surroundings,
can set free from all moral disadvantages adhering
to men&#8217;s station, class, or calling, can break the
entail of sin. The worst needs no intercessor to
sway that tender heart of our great Master whom
we may dimly see shadowed in the very name of
&ldquo;Philemon,&rdquo; which means one who is loving or
kindly. Whoever confesses to him that he has
&ldquo;been an unprofitable servant,&rdquo; will be welcomed to
His heart, made pure and good by the Divine Spirit
breathing new life into him, will be trained by Christ
for all joyful toil as His slave, and yet His freedman
and friend; and at last each once fugitive and
unprofitable Onesimus will hear the &ldquo;Well done,
good and faithful servant!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PhilIV" id="PhilIV"></a>IV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my
very heart: whom I would fain have kept with me, that in my behalf
he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel: but without thy
mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of
necessity, but of free will.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philem.</span> 12&ndash;14 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The characteristic features of the Epistle are all
embodied in these verses. They set forth, in
the most striking manner, the relation of Christianity
to slavery and to other social evils. They afford
an exquisite example of the courteous delicacy and
tact of the Apostle&#8217;s intervention on behalf of
Onesimus; and there shine through them, as through
a semi-transparent medium, adumbrations and shimmering
hints of the greatest truths of Christianity.</p>

<p>I. The first point to notice is that decisive step
of sending back the fugitive slave. Not many
years ago the conscience of England was stirred
because the Government of the day sent out a
circular instructing captains of men-of-war, on the
decks of which fugitive slaves sought asylum, to
restore them to their &ldquo;owners.&rdquo; Here an Apostle
does the same thing&mdash;seems to side with the
oppressor, and to drive the oppressed from the sole
refuge left him, the horns of the very altar. More
extraordinary still, here is the fugitive voluntarily
going back, travelling all the weary way from Rome
to Colossæ in order to put his neck once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
beneath the yoke. Both men were acting from
Christian motives, and thought that they were doing
a piece of plain Christian duty. Then does Christianity
sanction slavery? Certainly not; its principles
cut it up by the roots. A gospel, of which
the starting-point is that all men stand on the same
level, as loved by the one Lord, and redeemed by
the one cross, can have no place for such an
institution. A religion which attaches the highest
importance to man&#8217;s awful prerogative of freedom,
because it insists on every man&#8217;s individual responsibility
to God, can keep no terms with a system
which turns men into chattels. Therefore Christianity
cannot but regard slavery as sin against God,
and as treason towards man. The principles of the
gospel worked into the conscience of a nation
destroy slavery. Historically it is true that as
Christianity has grown slavery has withered. But
the New Testament never directly condemns it, and
by regulating the conduct of Christian masters, and
recognising the obligations of Christian slaves, seems
to contemplate its continuance, and to be deaf to the
sighing of the captives.</p>

<p>This attitude was probably not a piece of policy
or a matter of calculated wisdom on the part of
the Apostle. He no doubt saw that the Gospel
brought a great unity in which all distinctions were
merged, and rejoiced in thinking that &ldquo;in Christ
Jesus there is neither bond or free&rdquo;; but whether
he expected the distinction ever to disappear from
actual life is less certain. He may have thought
of slavery as he did of sex, that the fact would
remain, while yet &ldquo;we are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;
It is by no means necessary to suppose that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Apostles saw the full bearing of the truths they had
to preach, in their relation to social conditions.
They were inspired to give the Church the principles.
It remained for future ages, under Divine guidance,
to apprehend the destructive and formative range of
these principles.</p>

<p>However this may be, the attitude of the New
Testament to slavery is the same as to other unchristian
institutions. It brings the leaven, and lets
it work. That attitude is determined by three great
principles. First, the message of Christianity is
primarily to individuals, and only secondarily to
society. It leaves the units whom it has influenced
to influence the mass. Second, it acts on spiritual
and moral sentiment, and only afterwards and
consequently on deeds or institutions. Third, it
hates violence, and trusts wholly to enlightened
conscience. So it meddles directly with no political
or social arrangements, but lays down principles
which will profoundly affect these, and leaves them
to soak into the general mind. If an evil needs
force for its removal, it is not ready for removal.
If it has to be pulled up by violence, a bit of the
root will certainly be left and will grow again.
When a dandelion head is ripe, a child&#8217;s breath can
detach the winged seeds; but until it is, no tempest
can move them. The method of violence is noisy
and wasteful, like the winter torrents that cover acres
of good ground with mud and rocks, and are past in
a day. The only true way is, by slow degrees to
create a state of feeling which shall instinctively
abhor and cast off the evil. Then there will be no
hubbub and no waste, and the thing once done will
be done for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
So has it been with slavery; so will it be with
war, and intemperance, and impurity, and the
miserable anomalies of our present civilization. It
has taken eighteen hundred years for the whole
Church to learn the inconsistency of Christianity
with slavery. We are no quicker learners than the
past generations were. God is patient, and does
not seek to hurry the march of His purposes. We
have to be imitators of God, and shun the &ldquo;raw
haste&rdquo; which is &ldquo;half-sister to delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But patience is not passivity. It is a Christian&#8217;s
duty to &ldquo;hasten the day of the Lord,&rdquo; and to take
part in the educational process which Christ is
carrying on through the ages, by submitting himself
to it in the first place, and then by endeavouring to
bring others under its influence. His place should
be in the van of all social progress. It does not
become Christ&#8217;s servants to be content with the
attainments of any past or present, in the matter of
the organization of society on Christian principles.
&ldquo;God has more light to break forth from His word.&rdquo;
Coming centuries will look back on the obtuseness
of the moral perceptions of nineteenth century
Christians in regard to matters of Christian duty
which, hidden from us, are sun-clear to them, with
the same half-amused, half-tragic wonder with which
we look back to Jamaica planters or South Carolina
rice growers, who defended slavery as a missionary
institution, and saw no contradiction between their
religion and their practice. We have to stretch our
charity to believe in these men&#8217;s sincere religion.
Succeeding ages will have to make the same allowance
for us, and will need it for themselves from
their successors. The main thing is, for us to try to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
keep our spirits open to all the incidence of the
gospel on social and civic life, and to see that we
are on the right side, and trying to help on the
approach of that kingdom which does &ldquo;not cry, nor
lift up, nor cause its voice to be heard in the streets,&rdquo;
but has its coming &ldquo;prepared as the morning,&rdquo; that
swims up, silent and slow, and flushes the heaven
with an unsetting light.</p>

<p>II. The next point in these verses is Paul&#8217;s loving
identification of himself with Onesimus.</p>

<p>The A.V. here follows another reading from the
R.V.; the former has &ldquo;thou therefore receive him,
that is, mine own bowels.&rdquo; The additional words
are unquestionably inserted without authority in
order to patch a broken construction. The R.V.
cuts the knot in a different fashion by putting the
abrupt words, &ldquo;himself that is, my very own heart,&rdquo;
under the government of the preceding verb. But
it seems more probable that the Apostle began a
new sentence with them, which he meant to have
finished as the A.V. does for him, but which, in fact,
got hopelessly upset in the swift rush of his thoughts,
and does not right itself grammatically till the
&ldquo;receive him&rdquo; of <i>v.</i> 17.</p>

<p>In any case the main thing to observe is the
affectionate plea which he puts in for the cordial
reception of Onesimus. Of course &ldquo;mine own
bowels&rdquo; is simply the Hebrew way of saying &ldquo;mine
own heart.&rdquo; We think the one phrase graceful and
sentimental, and the other coarse. A Jew did not
think so, and it might be difficult to say why he
should. It is a mere question of difference in
localizing certain emotions. Onesimus was a piece
of Paul&#8217;s very heart, part of himself; the unprofitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
slave had wound himself round his affections, and
become so dear that to part with him was like
cutting his heart out of his bosom. Perhaps some
of the virtues, which the servile condition helps to
develop in undue proportion, such as docility,
lightheartedness, serviceableness, had made him a
soothing and helpful companion. What a plea that
would be with one who loved Paul as well as
Philemon did! He could not receive harshly one
whom the Apostle had so honoured with his love.
&ldquo;Take care of him, be kind to him as if it were
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such language from an Apostle about a slave
would do more to destroy slavery than any violence
would do. Love leaps the barrier, and it ceases to
separate. So these simple, heart-felt words are an
instance of one method by which Christianity wars
against all social wrongs, by casting its caressing
arm around the outcast, and showing that the abject
and oppressed are objects of its special love.</p>

<p>They teach too how interceding love makes its
object part of its very self; the same thought recurs
still more distinctly in <i>v.</i> 17, &ldquo;Receive him as myself.&rdquo;
It is the natural language of love; some of
the deepest and most blessed Christian truths are but
the carrying out of that identification to its fullest
extent. We are all Christ&#8217;s Onesimuses, and He,
out of His pure love, makes Himself one with us,
and us one with Him. The union of Christ with all
who trust in Him, no doubt, presupposes His Divine
nature, but still there is a human side to it, and it is
the result of His perfect love. All love delights to
fuse itself with its object, and as far as may be
to abolish the distinction of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;thou.&rdquo; But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
human love can travel but a little way on that road;
Christ&#8217;s goes much farther. He that pleads for some
poor creature feels that the kindness is done to himself
when the former is helped or pardoned. Imperfectly
but really these words shadow forth the great
fact of Christ&#8217;s intercession for us sinners, and our
acceptance in Him. We need no better symbol of
the stooping love of Christ, Who identifies Himself
with His brethren, and of our wondrous identification
with Him, our High Priest and Intercessor, than this
picture of the Apostle pleading for the runaway and
bespeaking a welcome for him as part of himself.
When Paul says, &ldquo;Receive him, that is, my very
heart,&rdquo; his words remind us of the yet more blessed
ones, which reveal a deeper love and more marvellous
condescension, &ldquo;He that receiveth you receiveth
Me,&rdquo; and may reverently be taken as a faint shadow
of that prevailing intercession, through which he that
is joined to the Lord and is one spirit with Him, is
received of God as part of Christ&#8217;s mystical body,
bone of His bone, and flesh of His flesh.</p>

<p>III. Next comes the expression of a half-formed
purpose which was put aside for a reason to be immediately
stated. &ldquo;Whom I would fain have kept
with me&rdquo;; the tense of the verb indicating the incompleteness
of the desire. The very statement of
it is turned into a graceful expression of Paul&#8217;s confidence
in Philemon&#8217;s goodwill to him, by the addition
of that &ldquo;on thy behalf.&rdquo; He is sure that, if his friend
had been beside him, he would have been glad to
lend him his servant, and so he would have liked to
have had Onesimus as a kind of representative of the
service which he knows would have been so willingly
rendered. The purpose for which he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
liked to keep him is defined as being, &ldquo;that he might
minister to me in the bonds of the Gospel.&rdquo; If the
last words be connected with &ldquo;me,&rdquo; they suggest a
tender reason why Paul should be ministered to, as
suffering for Christ, their common Master, and for
the truth, their common possession. If, as is perhaps
less probable, they be connected with &ldquo;minister,&rdquo; they
describe the sphere in which the service is to be rendered.
Either the master or the slave would be
bound by the obligations which the Gospel laid on
them to serve Paul. Both were his converts, and
therefore knit to him by a welcome chain, which
made service a delight.</p>

<p>There is no need to enlarge on the winning courtesy
of these words, so full of happy confidence in
the friend&#8217;s disposition, that they could not but evoke
the love to which they trusted so completely. Nor
need I do more than point their force for the purpose
of the whole letter, the procuring a cordial reception
for the returning fugitive. So dear had he become,
that Paul would like to have kept him. He goes
back with a kind of halo round him, now that he is
not only a good-for-nothing runaway, but Paul&#8217;s
friend, and so much prized by him. It would be
impossible to do anything but welcome him, bringing
such credentials; and yet all this is done with
scarcely a word of direct praise, which might have
provoked contradiction. One does not know whether
the confidence in Onesimus or in Philemon is the
dominant note in the harmony. In the preceding
clause, he was spoken of as, in some sense, part of
the Apostle&#8217;s very self. In this, he is regarded as,
in some sense, part of Philemon. So he is a link
between them. Paul would have taken his service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
as if it had been his master&#8217;s. Can the master fail
to take him as if he were Paul?</p>

<p>IV. The last topic in these verses is the decision
which arrested the half-formed wish. &ldquo;I was <i>wishing</i>
indeed, but I <i>willed</i> otherwise.&rdquo; The language
is exact. There is a universe between &ldquo;I wished&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I willed.&rdquo; Many a good wish remains fruitless,
because it never passes into the stage of firm
resolve. Many who wish to be better will to be
bad. One strong &ldquo;I will&rdquo; can paralyse a million
wishes.</p>

<p>The Apostle&#8217;s final determination was, to do
nothing without Philemon&#8217;s cognisance and consent.
The reason for the decision is at once a very triumph
of persuasiveness, which would be ingenious if it
were not so spontaneous, and an adumbration of
the very spirit of Christ&#8217;s appeal for service to us.
&ldquo;That thy benefit&rdquo;&mdash;the good done to me by him,
which would in my eyes be done by you&mdash;&ldquo;should
not be as of necessity, but willingly.&rdquo; That &ldquo;as&rdquo;
is a delicate addition. He will not think that the
benefit would really have been by constraint, but it
might have looked as if it were.</p>

<p>Do not these words go much deeper than this
small matter? And did not Paul learn the spirit
that suggested them from his own experience of
how Christ treated him? The principle underlying
them is, that where the bond is love, compulsion
takes the sweetness and goodness out of even sweet
and good things. Freedom is essential to virtue.
If a man &ldquo;could not help it&rdquo; there is neither praise
nor blame due. That freedom Christianity honours
and respects. So in reference to the offer of the
gospel blessings, men are not forced to accept them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
but appealed to, and can turn deaf ears to the
pleading voice, &ldquo;Why will ye die?&rdquo; Sorrows and
sins and miseries without end continue, and the
gospel is rejected, and lives of wretched godlessness
are lived, and a dark future pulled down on the
rejecters&#8217; heads&mdash;and all because God knows that
these things are better than that men should be
forced into goodness, which indeed would cease to
be goodness if they were. For nothing is good but
the free turning of the will to goodness, and nothing
bad but its aversion therefrom.</p>

<p>The same solemn regard for the freedom of the
individual and low estimate of the worth of constrained
service influence the whole aspect of Christian
ethics. Christ wants no pressed men in His army.
The victorious host of priestly warriors, which the
Psalmist saw following the priest-king in the day of
his power, numerous as the dewdrops, and radiant
with reflected beauty as these, were all &ldquo;willing&rdquo;&mdash;volunteers.
There are no conscripts in the ranks.
These words might be said to be graven over the
gates of the kingdom of heaven, &ldquo;Not as of necessity,
but willingly.&rdquo; In Christian morals, law becomes
love, and love, law. &ldquo;Must&rdquo; is not in the Christian
vocabulary, except as expressing the sweet constraint
which bows the will of him who loves to harmony,
which is joy, with the will of Him who is loved.
Christ takes no offerings which the giver is not glad
to render. Money, influence, service, which are not
offered by a will moved by love, which love, in its
turn, is set in motion by the recognition of the
infinite love of Christ in His sacrifice, are, in His
eyes, nought. An earthenware cup with a drop of
cold water in it, freely given out of a glad heart, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
richer and more precious in His sight than golden
chalices swimming with wine and melted pearls,
which are laid by constraint on His table. &ldquo;I
delight to do Thy will&rdquo; is the foundation of all
Christian obedience; and the servant had caught
the very tone of the Lord&#8217;s voice when he said,
&ldquo;Without thy mind I will do nothing, that thy
benefit should not be, as it were, of necessity, but
willingly.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that
thou shouldest have him for ever; no longer as a servant, but more
than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather
to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. If then thou countest me
a partner, receive him as myself. But if he hath wronged thee at all,
or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account; I Paul write it with
mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee how that thou
owest to me even thine own self besides.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philem.</span> 15&ndash;19 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>The first words of these verses are connected
with the preceding by the &ldquo;for&rdquo; at the beginning;
that is to say, the thought that possibly the
Divine purpose in permitting the flight of Onesimus
was his restoration, in eternal and holy relationship,
to Philemon, was Paul&#8217;s reason for not carrying out
his wish to keep Onesimus as his own attendant
and helper. &ldquo;I did not decide, though I very much
wished, to retain him without your consent, because
it is possible that he was allowed to flee from you,
though his flight was his own blamable act, in
order that he might be given back to you, a richer
possession, a brother instead of a slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. There is here a Divine purpose discerned as
shining through a questionable human act.</p>

<p>The first point to note is, with what charitable
delicacy of feeling the Apostle uses a mild word to
express the fugitive&#8217;s flight. He will not employ
the harsh naked word &ldquo;ran away.&rdquo; It might irritate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
Philemon. Besides, Onesimus has repented of his
faults, as is plain from the fact of his voluntary
return, and therefore there is no need for dwelling
on them. The harshest, sharpest words are best
when callous consciences are to be made to wince;
but words that are balm and healing are to be used
when men are heartily ashamed of their sins. So
the deed for which Philemon&#8217;s forgiveness is asked
is half veiled in the phrase &ldquo;he was parted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only so, but the word suggests that behind
the slave&#8217;s mutiny and flight there was another Will
working, of which, in some sense, Onesimus was but
the instrument. He &ldquo;<i>was</i> parted&rdquo;&mdash;not that he
was not responsible for his flight, but that, through
his act, which in the eyes of all concerned was
wrong, Paul discerns as dimly visible a great Divine
purpose.</p>

<p>But he puts that as only a possibility: &ldquo;<i>Perhaps</i>
he departed from thee.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;He will not be too
sure of what God means by such and such a thing,
as some of us are wont to be, as if we had been
sworn of God&#8217;s privy council. &ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo; is one of
the hardest words for minds of a certain class to
say; but in regard to all such subjects, and to many
more, it is the motto of the wise man, and the
shibboleth which sifts out the patient, modest lovers
of truth from rash theorists and precipitate dogmatisers.
Impatience of uncertainty is a moral
fault which mars many an intellectual process; and
its evil effects are nowhere mote visible than in the
field of theology. A humble &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; often grows
into a &ldquo;verily, verily&rdquo;&mdash;and a hasty, over-confident
&ldquo;verily, verily,&rdquo; often dwindles to a hesitating &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;
Let us not be in too great a hurry to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
sure that we have the key of the cabinet where
God keeps His purposes, but content ourselves with
&ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; when we are interpreting the often
questionable ways of His providences, each of which
has many meanings and many ends.</p>

<p>But however modestly he may hesitate as to the
application of the principle, Paul has no doubt as to
the principle itself: namely, that God, in the sweep
of His wise providence, utilizes even men&#8217;s evil, and
works it in, to the accomplishment of great purposes
far beyond their ken, as nature, in her patient
chemistry, takes the rubbish and filth of the dunghill
and turns them into beauty and food. Onesimus
had no high motives in his flight; he had run away
under discreditable circumstances, and perhaps to
escape deserved punishment. Laziness and theft had
been the hopeful companions of his flight, which,
so far as he was concerned, had been the outcome
of low and probably criminal impulses; and yet
God had known how to use it so as to lead to his
becoming a Christian. &ldquo;With the wrath of man
Thou girdest Thyself,&rdquo; twisting and bending it so as
to be flexible in Thy hands, and &ldquo;the remainder
Thou dost restrain,&rdquo; How unlike were the seed
and the fruit&mdash;the flight of a good-for-nothing thief
and the return of a Christian brother! He meant
it not so; but in running away from his master, he
was running straight into the arms of his Saviour.
How little Onesimus knew what was to be the end
of that day&#8217;s work, when he slunk out of Philemon&#8217;s
house with his stolen booty hid away in his bosom!
And how little any of us know where we are going,
and what strange results may evolve themselves
from our actions! Blessed they who can rest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
confidence that, however modest we should be in
our interpretation of the events of our own or of
other men&#8217;s lives, the infinitely complex web of
circumstance is woven by a loving, wise Hand, and
takes shape, with all its interlacing threads, according
to a pattern in His hand, which will vindicate
itself when it is finished!</p>

<p>The contrast is emphatic between the short
absence and the eternity of the new relationship:
&ldquo;for a season&rdquo;&mdash;literally an hour&mdash;and &ldquo;for ever.&rdquo;
There is but one point of view which gives importance
to this material world, with all its fleeting joys
and fallacious possessions. Life is not worth living,
unless it be the vestibule to a life beyond. Why all
its discipline, whether of sorrow or joy, unless there
be another, ampler life, where we can use to nobler
ends the powers acquired and greatened by use
here? What an inconsequent piece of work is
man, if the few years of earth are his all! Surely,
if nothing is to come of all this life here, men are
made in vain, and had better not have been at all.
Here is a narrow sound, with a mere ribbon of sea
in it, shut in between grim, echoing rocks. How
small and meaningless it looks as long as the fog
hides the great ocean beyond! But when the mist
lifts, and we see that the narrow strait leads out into
a boundless sea that lies flashing in the sunshine to
the horizon, then we find out the worth of that little
driblet of water at our feet. It connects with the
open sea, and that swathes the world. So is it with
&ldquo;the hour&rdquo; of life; it opens out and debouches into
the &ldquo;for ever,&rdquo; and therefore it is great and solemn.
This moment is one of the moments of that hour.
We are the sport of our own generalisations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
ready to admit all these fine and solemn things
about life, but we are less willing to apply them to
the single moments as they fly. We should not
rest content with recognising the general truth, but
ever make conscious effort to feel that <i>this</i> passing
instant has something to do with our eternal character
and with our eternal destiny.</p>

<p>That is an exquisitely beautiful and tender thought
which the Apostle puts here, and one which is
susceptible of many applications. The temporary
loss may be eternal gain. The dropping away of
the earthly form of a relationship may, in God&#8217;s
great mercy, be a step towards its renewal in higher
fashion and for evermore. All our blessings need
to be past before reflection can be brought to bear
upon them, to make us conscious how blessed we
were. The blossoms have to perish before the rich
perfume, which can be kept in undiminished fragrance
for years, can be distilled from them. When
death takes away dear ones, we first learn that we
were entertaining angels unawares; and as they
float away from us into the light, they look back
with faces already beginning to brighten into the
likeness of Christ, and take leave of us with His
valediction, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go
away.&rdquo; Memory teaches us the true character of
life. We can best estimate the height of the
mountain peaks when we have left them behind.
The softening and hallowing influence of death
reveals the nobleness and sweetness of those who
are gone. Fair country never looks so fair as when
it has a curving river for a foreground; and fair lives
look fairer than before, when seen across the Jordan
of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
To us who believe that life and love are not
killed by death, the end of their earthly form is
but the beginning of a higher heavenly. Love which
is &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; is eternal. Because Philemon and
Onesimus were two Christians, therefore their relationship
was eternal. Is it not yet more true, if
that were possible, that the sweet bonds which unite
Christian souls here on earth are in their essence
indestructible, and are affected by death only as the
body is? Sown in weakness, will they not be raised
in power? Nothing of them shall die but the
encompassing death. Their mortal part shall put
on immortality. As the farmer gathers the green
flax with its blue bells blooming on it, and throws it
into a tank to rot, in order to get the firm fibre
which cannot rot, and spin it into a strong cable, so
God does with our earthly loves. He causes all
about them that is perishable to perish, that the
central fibre, which is eternal, may stand clear and
disengaged from all that was less Divine than itself.
Wherefore mourning hearts may stay themselves on
this assurance, that they will never lose the dear
ones whom they have loved in Christ, and that death
itself but changes the manner of the communion,
and refines the tie. They were as for a moment
dead, but they are alive again. To our bewildered
sight they departed and were lost for a season, but
they are found, and we can fold them in our heart of
hearts for ever.</p>

<p>But there is also set forth here a change, not
only in the duration but in the quality of the relation
between the Christian master and his former slave,
who continues a slave indeed, but is also a brother.
&ldquo;No longer as a servant, but more than a servant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much
rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.&rdquo;
It is clear from these words that Paul did not anticipate
the manumission of Onesimus. What he
asks is, that he should not be received <i>as</i> a slave.
Evidently then he is to be still a slave in so far as
the outward fact goes&mdash;but a new spirit is to be
breathed into the relationship. &ldquo;Specially to me&rdquo;;
he is more than a slave to me. I have not looked
on him as such, but have taken him to my heart as
a brother, as a son indeed, for he is especially dear
to me as my convert. But however dear he is to
me, he should be more so to thee, to whom his relation
is permanent, while to me it is temporary. And this
Brotherhood of the slave is to be felt and made
visible &ldquo;both in the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in the earthly
and personal relations of common life, &ldquo;and in the
Lord&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in the spiritual and religious relationships
of worship and the Church.</p>

<p>As has been well said, &ldquo;In the flesh, Philemon
has the brother for his slave; in the Lord, Philemon
has the slave for his brother.&rdquo; He is to treat him
as his brother therefore both in the common relationships
of every-day life and in the acts of
religious worship.</p>

<p>That is a pregnant word. True, there is no gulf
between Christian people now-a-days like that which
in the old times parted owner and slave; but, as
society becomes more and more differentiated, as
the diversities of wealth become more extreme in
our commercial communities, as education comes to
make the educated man&#8217;s whole way of looking at
life differ more and more from that of the less
cultured classes, the injunction implied in our text
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
encounters enemies quite as formidable as slavery
ever was. The highly educated man is apt to be
very oblivious of the brotherhood of the ignorant
Christian, and he, on his part, finds the recognition
just as hard. The rich mill-owner has not much
sympathy with the poor brother who works at his
spinning-jennies. It is often difficult for the
Christian mistress to remember that her cook is her
sister in Christ. There is quite as much sin against
fraternity on the side of the poor Christians who
are servants and illiterate, as on the side of the
rich who are masters or cultured. But the principle
that Christian brotherhood is to reach across
the wall of class distinctions is as binding to-day
as it was on these two good people, Philemon the
master and Onesimus the slave.</p>

<p>That brotherhood is not to be confined to acts
and times of Christian communion, but is to be
shown and to shape conduct in common life. &ldquo;Both
in the flesh and in the Lord&rdquo; may be put into
plain English thus: A rich man and a poor one
belong to the same church; they unite in the same
worship, they are &ldquo;partakers of the one bread,&rdquo; and
therefore, Paul thinks, &ldquo;are one bread.&rdquo; They go
outside the church door. Do they ever dream of
speaking to one another outside? &ldquo;A brother
beloved in the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;on Sundays, and during
worship and in Church matters&mdash;is often a stranger
&ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; on Mondays, in the street and in
common life. Some good people seem to keep
their brotherly love in the same wardrobe with their
Sunday clothes. Philemon was bid, and all are
bid, to wear it all the week, at market as well as
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
II. In the next verse, the essential purpose for
which the whole letter was written is put at last
in an articulate request, based upon a very tender
motive. &ldquo;If then thou countest me as a partner,
receive him as myself,&rdquo; Paul now at last completes
the sentence which he began in <i>v</i>. 12, and from
which he was hurried away by the other thoughts
that came crowding in upon him. This plea for
the kindly welcome to be accorded to Onesimus has
been knocking at the door of his lips for utterance
from the beginning of the letter; but only now,
so near the end, after so much conciliation, he
ventures to put it into plain words; and even now
he does not dwell on it, but goes quickly on to
another point. He puts his requests on a modest
and yet a strong ground, appealing to Philemon&#8217;s
sense of comradeship&mdash;&ldquo;if thou countest me a partner&rdquo;&mdash;a
comrade or a sharer in Christian blessings.
He sinks all reference to apostolic authority, and
only points to their common possession of faith,
hope, and joy in Christ. &ldquo;Receive him as myself.&rdquo;
That request was sufficiently illustrated in the
preceding chapter, so that I need only refer to what
was then said on this instance of interceding love
identifying itself with its object, and on the enunciation
in it of great Christian truth.</p>

<p>III. The course of thought next shows&mdash;Love
taking the slave&#8217;s debts on itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught.&rdquo;
Paul makes an &ldquo;if&rdquo; of what he knew well enough
to be the fact; for no doubt Onesimus had told
him all his faults, and the whole context shows that
there was no uncertainty in Paul&#8217;s mind, but that
he puts the wrong hypothetically for the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
reason for which he chooses to say, &ldquo;was parted&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;ran away,&rdquo; namely, to keep some thin
veil over the crimes of a penitent, and not to rasp
him with rough words. For the same reason, too,
he falls back upon the gentler expressions,
&ldquo;wronged&rdquo; and &ldquo;oweth,&rdquo; instead of blurting out
the ugly word &ldquo;stolen.&rdquo; And then, with a half-playful
assumption of lawyer-like phraseology, he
bids Philemon put that to his account. Here is my
autograph&mdash;&ldquo;I Paul write it with mine own hand&rdquo;&mdash;I
make this letter into a bond. Witness my
hand; &ldquo;I will repay it.&rdquo; The formal tone of the
promise, rendered more formal by the insertion of
the name&mdash;and perhaps by that sentence only being
in his own handwriting&mdash;seems to warrant the
explanation that it is half playful; for he could
never have supposed that Philemon would exact the
fulfilment of the bond, and we have no reason to
suppose that, if he had, Paul could really have paid
the amount. But beneath the playfulness there lies
the implied exhortation to forgive the money wrong
as well as the others which Onesimus had done
him.</p>

<p>The verb used here for <i>put to the account of</i> is,
according to the commentators, a very rare word;
and perhaps the singular phrase may be chosen to
let another great Christian truth shine through.
Was Paul&#8217;s love the only one that we know of which
took the slave&#8217;s debts on itself? Did anybody else
ever say, &ldquo;Put that on mine account&rdquo;? We have
been taught to ask for the forgiveness of our sins
as &ldquo;debts,&rdquo; and we have been taught that there
is One on whom God has made to meet the
iniquities of us all. Christ takes on Himself all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Paul&#8217;s debt, all Philemon&#8217;s, all ours. He has paid the
ransom for all, and He so identifies Himself with
men that He takes all their sins upon Him, and so
identifies men with Himself that they are &ldquo;received
as Himself.&rdquo; It is His great example that Paul
is trying to copy here. Forgiven all that great
debt, he dare not rise from his knees to take his
brother by the throat, but goes forth to show to his
fellow the mercy which he has found, and to model
his life after the pattern of that miracle of love
in which is his trust. It is Christ&#8217;s own voice which
echoes in &ldquo;put that on mine account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IV. Finally, these verses pass to a gentle reminder
of a greater debt: &ldquo;That I say not unto
thee how that thou owest to me even thine own self
besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his child in the Gospel, Philemon owed to
Paul much more than the trifle of money of which
Onesimus had robbed him; namely his spiritual life,
which he had received through the Apostle&#8217;s ministry.
But he will not insist on that. True love never
presses its claims, nor recounts its services. Claims
which need to be urged are not worth urging. A
true, generous heart will never say, &ldquo;You ought to
do so much for me, because I have done so much
for you.&rdquo; To come down to that low level of
chaffering and barter is a dreadful descent from the
heights where the love which delights in giving
should ever dwell.</p>

<p>Does not Christ speak to us in the same language?
We owe ourselves to Him, as Lazarus
did, for He raises us from the death of sin to a
share in His own new, undying life. As a sick man
owes his life to the doctor who has cured him, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
a drowning man owes his to his rescuer, who dragged
him from the water and breathed into his lungs till
they began to work of themselves, as a child owes
its life to its parent&mdash;so we owe ourselves to Christ.
But He does not insist upon the debt; He gently
reminds us of it, as making His commandment
sweeter and easier to obey. Every heart that is
really touched with gratitude will feel, that the less
the giver insists upon his gifts, the more do they
impel to affectionate service. To be perpetually
reminded of them weakens their force as motives to
obedience, for it then appears as if they had not
been gifts of love at all, but bribes given by self-interest;
and the frequent reference to them sounds
like complaint. But Christ does not insist on His
claims, and therefore the remembrance of them ought
to underlie all our lives and to lead to constant glad
devotion.</p>

<p>One more thought may be drawn from the words.
The great debt which can never be discharged does
not prevent the debtor from receiving reward for the
obedience of love. &ldquo;I will repay it,&rdquo; even though
thou owest me thyself. Christ has bought us for
His servants by giving Himself and ourselves to us.
No work, no devotion, no love can ever repay our
debt to Him. From His love alone comes the
desire to serve Him; from His grace comes the
power. The best works are stained and incomplete,
and could only be acceptable to a Love that was
glad to welcome even unworthy offerings, and to
forgive their imperfections. Nevertheless He treats
them as worthy of reward, and crowns His own
grace in men with an exuberance of recompense far
beyond their deserts. He will suffer no man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
work for Him for nothing; but to each He gives
even here great reward <i>in</i> keeping His commandments,
and hereafter &ldquo;an exceeding great reward,&rdquo;
of which the inward joys and outward blessings that
now flow from obedience are but the earnest His
merciful allowance of imperfections treats even our
poor deeds as rewardable; and though eternal life
must ever be the <i>gift</i> of God, and no claim of merit
can be sustained before His judgment seat, yet the
measure of that life which is possessed here or hereafter
is accurately proportioned to and is, in a very
real sense, the consequence of obedience and service,
&ldquo;If any man&#8217;s work abide, he shall receive a
reward,&rdquo; and Christ&#8217;s own tender voice speaks the
promise, &ldquo;I will repay, albeit I say not unto thee
how thou owest to Me even thine own self besides.&rdquo;
Men do not really possess themselves unless they
yield themselves to Jesus Christ. He that loveth
his life shall lose it, and he that loseth himself, in
glad surrender of himself to his Saviour, he and only
he is truly lord and owner of his own soul. And to
such an one shall be given rewards beyond hope
and beyond measure&mdash;and, as the crown of all, the
blessed possession of Christ, and in it the full, true,
eternal possession of himself, glorified and changed
into the image of the Lord who loved him and gave
Himself for him.</p>

20&ndash;25 (Rev. Ver.).</p></div>

<p>We have already had occasion to point out that
Paul&#8217;s pleading with Philemon, and the
motives which he adduces, are expressions, on a
lower level, of the greatest principles of Christian
ethics. If the closing salutations be left out of sight
for the moment, there are here three verses, each
containing a thought which needs only to be cast
into its most general form to show itself as a large
Christian truth.</p>

<p>I. Verse 20 gives the final moving form of the
Apostle&#8217;s request. Onesimus disappears, and the
final plea is based altogether on the fact that compliance
will pleasure and help Paul. There is but
the faintest gleam of a possible allusion to the
former in the use of the verb from which the name
Onesimus is derived&mdash;&ldquo;Let me have <i>help</i> of thee&rdquo;;
as if he had said, &ldquo;Be you an Onesimus, a helpful
one to me, as I trust he is going to be to you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
&ldquo;Refresh my heart&rdquo; points back to <i>v.</i> 7, &ldquo;The hearts
of the saints have been refreshed by thee,&rdquo; and
lightly suggests that Philemon should do for Paul
what he had done for many others. But the
Apostle does not merely ask help and refreshing;
he desires that they should be of a right Christian
sort. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; is very significant. If Philemon
receives his slave for Christ&#8217;s sake and in the
strength of that communion with Christ which fits
for all virtue, and so for this good deed&mdash;a deed
which is of too high and rare a strain of goodness
for his unaided nature,&mdash;then &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; he will
be helpful to the Apostle. In that case the phrase
expresses the element or sphere in which the act is
done. But it may apply rather, or even also, to
Paul, and then it expresses the element or sphere in
which he is helped and refreshed. In communion
with Jesus, taught and inspired by Him, the Apostle
is brought to such true and tender sympathy with
the runaway that his heart is refreshed, as by a cup
of cold water, by kindness shown to him. Such
keen sympathy is as much beyond the reach of
nature as Philemon&#8217;s kindness would be. Both are
&ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; Union with Him refines selfishness,
and makes men quick to feel another&#8217;s sorrows
and joys as theirs, after the pattern of Him who
makes the case of God&#8217;s fugitives His own. It
makes them easy to be entreated and ready to forgive.
So to be in Him is to be sympathetic like
Paul, and placable as He would have Onesimus.
&ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; carries in it the secret of all sweet
humanities and beneficence, is the spell which calls
out fairest charity, and is the only victorious antagonist
of harshness and selfishness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
The request for the sake of which the whole letter
is written is here put as a kindness to Paul himself,
and thus an entirely different motive is appealed
to. &ldquo;Surely you would be glad to give me pleasure.
Then do this thing which I ask you.&rdquo; It is permissible
to seek to draw to virtuous acts by such
a motive, and to reinforce higher reasons by the
desire to please dear ones, or to win the approbation
of the wise and good. It must be rigidly kept as
a subsidiary motive, and distinguished from the mere
love of applause. Most men have some one whose
opinion of their acts is a kind of embodied conscience,
and whose satisfaction is reward. But pleasing
the dearest and purest among men can never
be more than at most a crutch to help lameness
or a spur to stimulate.</p>

<p>If however this motive be lifted to the higher
level, and these words thought of as Paul&#8217;s echo of
Christ&#8217;s appeal to those who love Him, they beautifully
express the peculiar blessedness of Christian
ethics. The strongest motive, the very mainspring
and pulsing heart of Christian duty, is to please
Christ. His language to His followers is not, &ldquo;Do
this because it is right,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Do this because it
pleaseth Me.&rdquo; They have a living Person to gratify,
not a mere law of duty to obey. The help which
is given to weakness by the hope of winning golden
opinions from, or giving pleasure to, those whom
men love is transferred in the Christian relation
to Jesus. So the cold thought of duty is warmed,
and the weight of obedience to a stony, impersonal
law is lightened, and a new power is enlisted on
the side of goodness, which sways more mightily
than all the abstractions of duty. The Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Himself makes His appeal to men in the same
tender fashion as Paul to Philemon. He will move
to holy obedience by the thought&mdash;wonderful as
it is&mdash;that it gladdens Him. Many a weak heart
has been braced and made capable of heroisms of
endurance and effort, and of angel deeds of mercy,
all beyond its own strength, by that great thought,
&ldquo;We labour that, whether present or absent, we may
be well-pleasing to Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. Verse 21 exhibits love commanding, in the
confidence of love obeying. &ldquo;Having confidence
in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that
thou wilt do even beyond what I say.&rdquo; In <i>v</i>. 8
the Apostle had waived his right to enjoin, because
he had rather speak the speech of love, and request.
But here, with the slightest possible touch, he just
lets the note of authority sound for a single moment,
and then passes into the old music of affection and
trust. He but names the word &ldquo;obedience,&rdquo; and
that in such a way as to present it as the child
of love, and the privilege of his friend. He trusts
Philemon&#8217;s obedience, because he knows his love,
and is sure that it is love of such a sort as will
not stand on the exact measure, but will delight
in giving it &ldquo;pressed down and running over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What could he mean by &ldquo;do more than I say&rdquo;?
Was he hinting at emancipation, which he would
rather have to come from Philemon&#8217;s own sense of
what was due to the slave who was now a brother,
than be granted, perhaps hesitatingly, in deference to
his request? Possibly, but more probably he had
no definite thing in his mind, but only desired to
express his loving confidence in his friend&#8217;s willingness
to please him. Commands given in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
tone, where authority audibly trusts the subordinate,
are far more likely to be obeyed than if they were
shouted with the hoarse voice of a drill-sergeant.
Men will do much to fulfil generous expectations.
Even debased natures will respond to such appeal;
and if they see that good is expected from them,
that will go far to evoke it. Some masters have
always good servants, and part of the secret is that
they trust them to obey. &ldquo;England expects&rdquo;
fulfilled itself. When love enjoins there should be
trust in its tones. It will act like a magnet to draw
reluctant feet into the path of duty. A will which
mere authority could not bend, like iron when cold,
may be made flexible when warmed by this gentle
heat. If parents oftener let their children feel that
they had confidence in their obedience, they would
seldomer have to complain of their disobedience.</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s commands follow, or rather set, this pattern.
He trusts His servants, and speaks to them
in a voice softened and confiding. He tells them
His wish, and commits Himself and His cause to
His disciples&#8217; love.</p>

<p>Obedience beyond the strict limits of command
will always be given by love. It is a poor, grudging
service which weighs obedience as a chemist does
some precious medicine, and is careful that not the
hundredth part of a grain more than the prescribed
amount shall be doled out. A hired workman will
fling down his lifted trowel full of mortar at the first
stroke of the clock, though it would be easier to lay
it on the bricks; but where affection moves the
hand, it is delight to add something over and above
to bare duty. The artist who loves his work will
put many a touch on it beyond the minimum which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
will fulfil his contract. Those who adequately feel
the power of Christian motives will not be anxious
to find the least that they durst, but the most that
they can do. If obvious duty requires them to go
a mile, they will rather go two, than be scrupulous
to stop as soon as they see the milestone. A child
who is always trying to find out how little would
satisfy his father cannot have much love. Obedience
to Christ is joy, peace, love. The grudging
servants are limiting their possession of these, by
limiting their active surrender of themselves. They
seem to be afraid of having too much of these
blessings. A heart truly touched by the love of
Jesus Christ will not seek to know the lowest limit
of duty, but the highest possibility of service.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Give all thou canst; high heaven rejects the lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nicely calculated less or more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>III. Verse 22 may be summed up as the language
of love, hoping for reunion. &ldquo;Withal prepare
me a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers
I shall be granted unto you.&rdquo; We do not know
whether the Apostle&#8217;s expectation was fulfilled. Believing
that he was set free from his first imprisonment,
and that his second was separated from it
by a considerable interval, during which he visited
Macedonia and Asia Minor, we have yet nothing
to show whether or not he reached Colossæ; but
whether fulfilled or not, the expectation of meeting
would tend to secure compliance with his request,
and would be all the more likely to do so, for the
very delicacy with which it is stated, so as not to
seem to be mentioned for the sake of adding force
to his intercession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
The limits of Paul&#8217;s expectation as to the power
of his brethren&#8217;s prayers for temporal blessings are
worth noting. He does believe that these good
people in Colossæ could help him by prayer for his
liberation, but he does not believe that their prayer
will certainly be heard. In some circles much is
said now about &ldquo;the prayer of faith&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase
which, singularly enough, is in such cases almost
confined to prayers for external blessings,&mdash;and
about its power to bring money for work which the
person praying believes to be desirable, or to send
away diseases. But surely there can be no &ldquo;faith&rdquo;
without a definite Divine <i>word</i> to lay hold of. Faith
and God&#8217;s promise are correlative; and unless a
man has God&#8217;s plain promise that A. B. will be cured
by his prayer, the belief that he will is not faith, but
something deserving a much less noble name. The
prayer of faith is not forcing our wills on God, but
bending our wills to God&#8217;s. The prayer which Christ
has taught in regard to all outward things is, &ldquo;Not
my will but Thine be done,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;May Thy will
become mine.&rdquo; That is the prayer of faith, which
is always answered. The Church prayed for Peter,
and he was delivered; the Church, no doubt, prayed
for Stephen, and he was stoned. Was then the
prayer for him refused? Not so, but if it were
prayer at all, the inmost meaning of it was &ldquo;be it
as Thou wilt&rdquo;; and that was accepted and answered.
Petitions for outward blessings, whether for
the petitioner or for others, are to be presented with
submission; and the highest confidence which can
be entertained concerning them is that which Paul
here expresses: &ldquo;I <i>hope</i> that through your prayers
I shall be set free.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
The prospect of meeting enhances the force of
the Apostle&#8217;s wish; nor are Christians without an
analogous motive to give weight to their obligations
to their Lord. Just as Paul quickened Philemon&#8217;s
loving wish to serve him by the thought that he
might have the gladness of seeing him before long,
so Christ quickens His servant&#8217;s diligence by the
thought that before very many days He will come,
or they will go&mdash;at any rate, they will be with
Him,&mdash;and He will see what they have been doing
in His absence. Such a prospect should increase
diligence, and should not inspire terror. It is a
mark of true Christians that they &ldquo;love His appearing.&rdquo;
Their hearts should glow at the hope of
meeting. That hope should make work happier
and lighter. When a husband has been away at sea,
the prospect of his return makes the wife sing at
her work, and take more pains or rather pleasure
with it, because his eye is to see it. So should it be
with the bride in the prospect of her bridegroom&#8217;s
return. The Church should not be driven to unwelcome
duties by the fear of a strict judgment,
but drawn to large, cheerful service, by the hope
of spreading her work before her returning Lord.</p>

<p>Thus, on the whole, in this letter, the central
springs of Christian service are touched, and the
motives used to sway Philemon are the echo of the
motives which Christ uses to sway men. The keynote
of all is love. Love beseeches when it might
command. To love we owe our own selves beside.
Love will do nothing without the glad consent of
him to whom it speaks, and cares for no service
which is of necessity. Its finest wine is not made
from juice which is pressed out of the grapes, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
from that which flows from them for very ripeness.
Love identifies itself with those who need its help,
and treats kindnesses to them as done to itself.
Love finds joy and heart solace in willing, though
it be imperfect, service. Love expects more than
it asks. Love hopes for reunion, and by the hope
makes its wish more weighty. These are the points
of Paul&#8217;s pleading with Philemon. Are they not
the elements of Christ&#8217;s pleading with His friends?</p>

<p>He too prefers the tone of friendship to that of
authority. To Him His servants owe themselves,
and remain for ever in His debt, after all payment
of reverence and thankful self-surrender. He does
not count constrained service as service at all, and
has only volunteers in His army. He makes Himself
one with the needy, and counts kindness to the
least as done to Him. He binds Himself to repay
and overpay all sacrifice in His service. He finds
delight in His people&#8217;s work. He asks them to
prepare an abode for Him in their own hearts, and
in souls opened by their agency for His entrance.
He has gone to prepare a mansion for them, and
He comes to receive account of their obedience
and to crown their poor deeds. It is impossible to
suppose that Paul&#8217;s pleading for Philemon failed.
How much less powerful is Christ&#8217;s, even with those
who love Him best?</p>

<p>IV. The parting greetings may be very briefly
considered, for much that would have naturally been
said about them has already presented itself in
dealing with the similar salutations in the epistle
to Colossæ. The same people send messages here
as there; only Jesus called Justus being omitted,
probably for no other reason than because he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
not at hand at the moment. Epaphras is naturally
mentioned singly, as being a Colossian, and therefore
more closely connected with Philemon than
were the others. After him come the two Jews and
the two Gentiles, as in Colossians.</p>

<p>The parting benediction ends the letter. At the
beginning of the epistle Paul invoked grace upon the
household &ldquo;from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Now he conceives of it as Christ&#8217;s
gift. In him all the stooping, bestowing love of
God is gathered, that from Him it may be poured
on the world. That grace is not diffused like
stellar light, through some nebulous heaven, but
concentrated in the Sun of Righteousness, who is the
light of men. That fire is piled on a hearth that,
from it, warmth may ray out to all that are in the
house.</p>

<p>That grace has man&#8217;s spirit for the field of its
highest operation. Thither it can enter, and there
it can abide, in union more close and communion
more real and blessed than aught else can attain.
The spirit which has the grace of Christ with it can
never be utterly solitary or desolate.</p>

<p>The grace of Christ is the best bond of family
life. Here it is prayed for on behalf of all the
group, the husband, wife, child, and the friends in
their home Church. Like grains of sweet incense
cast on an altar flame, and making fragrant what
was already holy, that grace sprinkled on the household
fire will give it an odour of a sweet smell,
grateful to men and acceptable to God.</p>

<p>That wish is the purest expression of Christian
friendship, of which the whole letter is so exquisite
an example. Written as it is about a common,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
every-day matter, which could have been settled
without a single religious reference, it is saturated
with Christian thought and feeling. So it becomes
an example of how to blend Christian sentiment
with ordinary affairs, and to carry a Christian
atmosphere everywhere. Friendship and social intercourse
will be all the nobler and happier, if
pervaded by such a tone. Such words as these
closing ones would be a sad contrast to much of the
intercourse of professedly Christian men. But every
Christian ought by his life to be, as it were, floating
the grace of God to others sinking for want of it to
lay hold of, and all his speech should be of a piece
with this benediction.</p>

<p>A Christian&#8217;s life should be &ldquo;an epistle of
Christ&rdquo; written with His own hand, wherein dim
eyes might read the transcript of His own gracious
love, and through all his words and deeds
should shine the image of his Master, even as it
does through the delicate tendernesses and gracious
pleadings of this pure pearl of a letter, which the
slave, become a brother, bore to the responsive hearts
in quiet Colossæ.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
